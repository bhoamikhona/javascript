But now, it is time to take a step back, and talk about the whole process of actually building modern JavaScript applications in the real-world. So, this section is not really about the language itself, but more about the development process i.e. the modern build tool that every professional developer uses, and also the whole modern ecosystem that has been created around JavaScript.",
