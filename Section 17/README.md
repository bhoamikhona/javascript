# Section 17: Modern JavaScript Development: Modules, Tooling, and Functional

**About:** Up until this point the course, we have learned a lot of JavaScript features, and syntax, and also, how the language itself works behind the scenes. But now, it is time to take a step back, and talk about the whole process of actually building modern JavaScript applications in the real-world. So, this section is not really about the language itself, but more about the development process i.e. the modern build tool that every professional developer uses, and also the whole modern ecosystem that has been created around JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned

### An Overview of Modern JavaScript Development

- Let's start the section with a general overview of Modern JavaScript development i.e. how we write JS today because, when we build applications, we don't just write all of our code into one big script and send that script as it is to the browser and call it a day.
- It used to be like that but, the way that we build JS applications today has changed tremendously over the last couple of years.

#### Modern JavaScript Development

- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ad777cb-c856-4323-a0bf-2650e86ef172)
- Back in the day, we used to write all our code into one big script or maybe multiple scripts, but today, we divide our projects into multiple modules; and these modules can share data between them and make our code more organized and maintainable.
- One great thing about modules is that we can also include 3rd party modules into our own code; and there are 1000s of open source modules, which we also call packages, that developers share on [NPM repository](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- We can then use these packages for free in our own code.
- For example, the popular React framework or jQuery, or even the Leaflet library, that we used before in our Mapty project. All these packages are available through NPM.
- NPM stands for Node Package Manager because it was originally developed together with Node.js and 4Node.js
- However, NPM has established itself as the go-to repository for all kinds of packages in Modern JavaScript Development.
- In order to actually download/use/share packages, we use the NPM software installed on our computer. It is just a simple comman line interface that allows us to do all that.
- So, NPM is basically both, the repository in which packages live and a program that we use on our computer to install and manage these packages.
- Let's say that we are done writing our project code. So, we divide it into multiple modules and we included some 3rd party modules as well. So now, the development step is complete.
- However, usually that's not the end of the story. At least not when re-building a real world application.
- Instead, our project now needs to go through a build process, where one big final JS bundle is built, and that's the final file, which we will deploy to our web server for production.
- Basically, it is the JS file that will be sent to the browsers in production.
- Production simply means that the application is being used by real users in the real world.
- A build process can be something relaly complex, but we are going to keep it simple and only include two steps:
  - First Step:
    - We will bundle all our modules together into one big file.
    - This is a pretty complex process which can eliminate unused code and compress our code as well.
    - This step is super important for 2 big reasons:
      - First, older browsers don't support modules at all. So, code that's in a module could not be executed by any old browser.
      - Second, it is also better for performance to send less files to the browser, and it is also beneficial that the bundling step compresses our code.
  - Second Step:
    - In the second step, we do something called transpiling and polyfiling, which is basically to convert all modern JS syntax and features back to old ES5 syntax, so that even older browsers can understand our code without breaking.
    - This is usually done using a tool called Babel.
- These are the two steps of our build process, and after these two steps, we end up with the final JS bundle, ready to be deployed on a server for production.
- Of course, we don't perform these steps ourselves. Instead, we use a special tool to implement this build process for us.
- The most common build tools available, are probably webpack and Parcel.
- These are called JS bundlers, because as the name suggests, they take our raw code and transform it into a JS bundle.
- Webpack is the more popular one, but it can be really hard and confusing to set it up. That's because there is a lot of stuff that we need to configure manually, in order to make it work properly.
- Parcel, on the other hand is a 0 configuration bundler, which simply works out of the box.
- So, in this bundler, we don't have to write any set up code, which is really amazing. This is the JS bundler that we will use later in this section.
- These development tools are actually also available on NPM.
- So, just like packages that we include in our code, we will download and manage tools using NPM as well.
- These tools include the live-server that we have been using all along, the Parcel bundler that we just talked about or Babel to transpile code back to ES5.
- So, this is a high-level overview, of how we develop modern JS applications today.
- This is actually really exciting stuff because, this is how professional developers actually write JS today.
- So, in the rest of the section, you will take a big step in the direction of becoming a professional developer too.

### An Overview of Modules in JavaScript

- Modules are a super important part of software development so, in this lesson, we are going to talk about modules in more depth and learn how they work behind the scenes.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b8d1106-78e5-438f-aac2-ef6697efed33)
- Essentially, a module is a re-usable piece of code that encapsulates implementation details of a certain part of our project.
- That sounds a bit like a function or even a class, but the difference is that a module is usually a stand alone file.
- That's not always the case but normally, when we think a module, we think of a separate file.
- So, of course a module always contains some code but it can also have imports and exports.
- With exports, as the name says, we can export values out of a module.
- For example, simple values or even entire functions.
- And whatever we export from a module is called a public API.
- So, this is just like classes where we can also expose a public API for other code to consume.
- In the case of modules, this public API is actually consumed by importing values into a module.
- So, just like we can export modules, we can usually also import values from other modules.
- These other modules from which we import are then called dependencies of the importing module because the code that is in the module that is importing cannot work without the code that is imported from the external module.
- This entire logic that we just described is true for all modules in all programming languages. This is not specific to only JS.
- In fact, modules are a pattern that developers have been using in all languages for decades.
- Of course we can write code without modules, and we have been doing that up until this point - but that's because our applications have been very simple.
- However, when a code base grows bigger and bigger, there start to be many advantages of using modules.
- The first one is that modules make it really easy to compose software.
- So, we can think of modules as small building blocks that we can then put together in order to build really complex applications.
- It might be helpful to look at a more real-world example to understand all the benefits of modules.
- Let's take this digital camera:
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee1ad3b8-7e26-4a03-a40e-92df58fad095)
- You can see that this specific camera is basically made up of all these modules that we can see in the image.
- This is exactly how we can compose software using modules as well.
- Another big advantage of these camera modules is that each of them can be developed in complete isolation.
- So, you can have one engineer working on the lens, another one on the screen and another one on the controller module.
- The best part of this is that each engineer can actually work on their own module without even understanding what the other engineers are doing; and also, without understanding how the entire final camera works itself.
- So, isolating components is another huge advantage of using modules.
- Again, isolating components essentially means that each module can be developed in isolation without the developer having to think about the entire code base.
- He doesn't even need to understand all of it, which makes it easy to collaborate on a larger team.
- Next up, modules make it very easy to abstract out code.
- And we already talked about what abstractionmeans, but basically, we can use modules to implement low-level code that other modules, which really don't care about these low-level details can import these abstractions and use them.
- Back to our camera, the screen module, for example, does not care about the low-level implementation details of the controller module.
- It can simply import the controller, but without knowing how it works; and use it to control other parts of the camera.
- So, that's essentially the power of abstraction.
- Modules also naturally lead to a more organized code base - because when we break up our code into separate isolated and abstracted modules, this will automatically organize our code and make it easier to understand.
- So, this alone, is a huge benefit of modules.
- Finally, modules allow us to easily re-use the same code in a project and even across multiple projects.
- For example, if we use the module to implement a couple of mathematical functions in a certain project, and if we then need the same functions in our next project, all we need to do is to copy that module.
- In our camera example, this company can now use the exact same lens or the exact same screen in different camera models, all because they nicely abstracted these components into self-contained re-usable modules.
- So, this is how modules work in software design in general.
- But now, let's take a look at modules specifically in JS.

### Native JavaScript (ES) Modules

- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39d60703-cf53-4ef8-86b3-bb266c4d6332)
- So, as of ES6, JavaScript has a native built-in module system.
- We did have modules before ES6 but, we had to implement them ourselves or use external libraries.
- So, ES6 modules are modules that are actually stored in files and each file is one module. So, there is exactly one module per file.
- But now you might be thinking, scripts are usually also files, right?
- That's of course true. So, let's now compare these two types of files in order to understand that there are actually huge differences between old school scripts and modern ES 6 modules.
- The first difference is that in modules, all top level variables are scoped to the module.
- So basically, variables are private to the module by default.
- The only way an outside module can access a value that's inside of a module is by exporting that value.
- Just as we learned a second ago.
- But if we don't export, then no one from the outside can see the variable.
- In scripts, on the other hand, all top-level variables are always global and we learned about this in the mapty project.
- This can lead to problems like global namespace pollution, where multiple scripts try to declare variables with the same name and then these variables collide.
- So, private variables are a solution to this problem and that's why ES6 modules implemented it like this.
- Next, ES modules are always executed in strict mode while scripts on the other hand are executed in sloppy mode by default.
- So, with modules, there is no more need to manually declare strict mode.
- Also, the `this` keyword is always `undefined` at the top level while in scripts, it points at the window object.
- Now, as we learned a couple of minutes ago, what's really special about modules is that we can export and import values between them using the ES6 import and export syntax.
- In regular scripts, importing and exporting values is just completely impossible.
- Now, there is something really important to note about imports and exports, which is the fact that it can only happen at the top-level i.e. outside of any function or if-block.
- We will see why in a second.
- Also, all imports are hoisted.
- So, no matter where in a code you are importing values, it is like the import statement will be moved to the top of the file.
- So, in practice, importing values is always the first thing that happens in a module.
- Now, in order to link a module to an HTML file, we need to use the `script` tag with the `type` attribute set to `module`, instead of just plain `script` tag.
- Finally, about downloading the module files themselves, this always automatically happens in an asynchronous way.
- This is true for a module loaded from HTML as well as for modules that are loaded by importing one module into another, using the `import` syntax.
- Now regular scripts on the other hand are downloaded by default in a blocking synchronous way, unless we use the `async` or `differ` attributes on the script tag.
- So, that's a great overview of the ES6 modules, but now, let's dig a little deeper and really understand how modules actually import other modules behind the scenes.

#### How ES6 Modules are Imported

- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a995eb-5830-4a02-bf3a-7c11ce653dd9)
- To do that, let's analyze what happens in this small code example:

```javascript
// index.js
import { rand } from './math.js';
import { showDice } from './dom.js';
const dice = rand(1, 6, 2);
showDice(dice);
```

- Here we are importing a value called `rand` from `math.js` module and `showDice` from `dom.js` module.
- As always, when a piece of code is executed, the first step is to parse that code.
- Remember that parsing basically means to just read the code, but without executing it.
- And this is the moment in which imports are hoisted.
- In fact, the whole process of importing modules happens before the code in the main module is actually executed.
- So in this example, the `index.js` module imports the `dom.js` and `math.js` modules in a synchronous way.
- What this means is that only after all imported modules have been downloaded and executed, the main `index.js` module will finally executed as well.
- This is only possible because of the top-level imports and exports that's because, if we only export and import values outside of any code that needs to be executed, then the engine can know all the imports and exports during the parsing phase i.e. while the code is still bein read - before being executed.
- Now, if we were allowed to import a module inside of a function, then that function would first have to be executed before the import code happened.
- So, in that case, modules cannot be imported in a synchronous way.
- So, the importing module would have to be executed first.
- But you might ask, why do we actually want modules to be loaded in a synchronous way>
- Isn't synchronous bad?
- The answer is that that is the easiest way in which we can do things like bundling and dead code elimination i.e. deleting code that's actually not even necessary.
- This is very important in large projects with hundreds of modules and that includes third party modules from which we usually only want a small piece and not the entire module.
- So, by knowing all the dependencies between modules before execution, bundlers like webpack and Parcel can then join multiple modules together and eliminate that code.
- So essentially, this is the reason why we can only import and export outside of any code that needs to be executed viz function or if-block.
- Moving on, after the parsing process has figured our which modules it needs to import, then these modules are actually downloaded from the server.
- Remember that downloading actually happens in an asynchronous way. It is only the importing operation itself that happens synchronously.
- Then after a module arrives, it is also parsed and the modules exports are linked to the imports in the index.js
- For example, the `math.js` module exports a function claled `rand` and this export is then connected to the `rand` import in the `index.js` module.
- This connection is actually a live connection. So, exported values are not copied to imports. Instead, the import is basically just a reference to the exported value - like a pointer.
- So, when the value changes int he exporting module, the same value also changes in the importing module.
- This is quite important to understand because it is unique to ES6 modules.
- Other module systems do not work like this, but JavaScript modules do. So, you need to keep that in mind.
- Anyway, next up, the code in the importing modules is executed. And with this, the processing of importing modules is finally finished.
- Now, let's move on to the next lesson and try all of this in actual code.

### Exporting and Importing in ES6 Modules

- Let's now use modules in practice, to make sure that we really understand how they work, and to import and export values between them.
- Let's start with the simplest scenario of all, which is to simply import a module, but without importing any value.
- That's also possible so, let's use that as a starting point here.
- As always, we start by creating with a script.js file, but, now as we want to create a new module, we simply have to create a new file.
- Here we are going to use the example of a shopping cart so, we are going to have a module called shoppingCart.js

> [!NOTE]
>
> In module names, it is also a convention to use camelCase names.

- script.js will be the importing module & shoppingCart.js will be the exporting module.
- To start, let's simply log to the console "Exporting Module" and "Importing Module" just so we can see that the module is actually being imported.

```javascript
// script.js
console.log('Importing Module');

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');
```

- Now, we also have to import the other module.

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
import './shoppingCart.js';

console.log('Importing Module');

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> ES modules actually also work without the file extension but for now, let's leave the extension there, just to make it a bit more clear.

- Let's start the live server and check the console.
- Right now we will see an error, so, at this point, our code won't be working.
- The error says "Cannot use import statement outside a module".
- Why is this happening?
- Remember from the last lesson, that when we want to connect a module to the HTML file, we actually need to specify the `type` attribute.
- So, in HTML, we need to specify that, like so:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script type="module" defer src="script.js"></script>
```

- Now the error will be gone, and our code should work.
- Now in the console, we see that the first log is actually "Exporting Module" and only then the "Importing Module" is logged to the console.
- So, this means that in fact, the shoppingCart.js is executed before script.js code i.e. the exporting module is executed before any importing module. Exactly what we learned in the last lesson.
- So, the code in the script.js file is parsed and before it is executed, all the code in the module that it imports is executed first.
- The same is true if we had the `console.log()` statement before importing the module, like so:

```javascript
// script.js
console.log('Importing Module');

// importing module
import './shoppingCart.js';

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');
```

- So remember that all the importing statements are basically hoisted to the top.
- Usually, we write all the importing statements to the top.

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
import './shoppingCart.js';

console.log('Importing Module');

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');
```

- Also note that we didn't use strict mode here and that's because as we learned in the last lesson, all the modules are executed in the strict mode by default.
- But now let's go back to the the shoppingCart.js module and define some variables.

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
import './shoppingCart.js';

console.log('Importing Module');

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];
```

- Now variables that are declared inside a module like `shippingcost` and `cart` are actually scoped to this module.
- Basically, inside a module, the module itself is like the top-level scope.
- By default, this means that all top-level variables are private inside of this variable.
- So, unline traditional scripts, which would put all of these variables in the global scope but again, not modules. So, that's why we cannot do this:

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
import './shoppingCart.js';

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];
```

- So the `shippingCost` and `cart` variables are scoped to the current module, basically. So, we can only use them in the shoppingCart.js
- If we wanted to use them in the script.js module, then we would have to use exports.
- In ES modules, there are two types of exports v.i.z. named export and default exports.
- Named exports is actually the simplest way of exporting something from a module, because all we have to do is to put `export` in front of anything, that we might want to export.
- So, let's say that we want to create a function called `addToCart()` and it should be a function that takes a product, and the quantity; and then it basically pushes the new object to the cart array, and logs something to the console.

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
import './shoppingCart.js';

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};
```

- Right now, this function is private inside of the shoppingCart.js module, but if we wanted to now export it, so that we can import it some other module, all we have to do is to write `export` in front of it, like so:

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
import './shoppingCart.js';

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};
```

- This then creates a named export from this module.
- So now, we can import that function in the script.js - we just have to write it with the exact same name.

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
// import './shoppingCart.js'; // simple import
import { addToCart } from './shoppingCart.js'; // named import

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};
```

- So, this is quite easy to understand. It reads almost like a regular English sentence.
- "We want to import `addToCart` from `shoppingCart` module."
- Again, `addToCart` the variable name in the importing module has to be exactly the same as the exporting module.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When importing a named variable, we need to put inside a set of curly braces otherwise it will throw an error.
>
> So, with named imports, we have to give them the same name as the export variable and put them inside a set of curly braces.

- Now we will be able to call the `addToCart` function inside the script.js module, as if it was defined inside the script.js file.

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
// import './shoppingCart.js'; // simple import
import { addToCart } from './shoppingCart.js'; // named import

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

addToCart('bread', 5);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};
```

- Indeed it works.
- Keep in mind that exports always need to happen in the top-level code. It wouldnt work if we put it inside an if-block or a function.

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
// import './shoppingCart.js'; // simple import
import { addToCart } from './shoppingCart.js'; // named import

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

addToCart('bread', 5);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

// This will not work.
// Exports always need to be on the top level code
if (true) {
  export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
    // SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'
    cart.push({ product, quantity });
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
  };
}
```

- Of course, we can also export multiple things from a module using named exports; and actually, that is the main use case of named exports.
- One of the ways we can do it is like so:

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
// import './shoppingCart.js'; // simple import
import { addToCart } from './shoppingCart.js'; // named import

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

addToCart('bread', 5);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity };
```

- So, this is a little bit like exporting an object from the shippingCart.js module.
- Now, just like before, we can import these variables in script.js using the exact same name. Again, we need to put those inside the curly braces because they are named exports.
- Once imported, we can use thsoe variables in script.js module. In our case, we will simply log them to the console.

```javascript
// script.js

// importing module
// import './shoppingCart.js'; // simple import
import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js'; // named import

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

addToCart('bread', 5);
console.log(totalPrice, totalQuantity);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity };
```

- Indeed, we get access to those values in script.js from shoppingCart.js
- We can also change the name of the imports as well using the `as` keyword.
- If we wanted to call `totalPrice` just `price` in script.js, then this is how we would do it:
  - After doing this, it will no longer be called `totalPrice` in script.js, it will be called `price`.
  - If we still use `totalPrice` after changing it to `price` it will throw an error.

```javascript
// script.js

// Simple module import
// import './shoppingCart.js';

// Named Import
// import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js';

// Renaming an import using `as` keyword
import {
  addToCart,
  totalPrice as price,
  totalQuantity,
} from './shoppingCart.js';

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

addToCart('bread', 5);
console.log(price, totalQuantity);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity };
```

- We can also change the name in the exports i.e. using the `as` keyword, like so:

```javascript
// script.js

// Simple Module Import
// import './shoppingCart.js';

// Named Import
// import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js';

// Renaming an import using `as` keyword
import { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';

console.log('Importing Module');

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

addToCart('bread', 5);
console.log(price, tq);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };
```

- After changing it at the exports, make sure to change the variable name to `tq` in script.js as well, because it will no longer be called `totalQuantity` in script.js - it will throw an error if we do that.
- So, this is all very flexible as you can see, and we can play around with it as we wish.
- And actually, we can take this importing even further, because we can also import all the exports of a module at the same time using `*`.
- We will have to use the `as` keyword with `*` so that we can reference it while using it. We usually name it with a capital camel case - it is a convention when we import everything into an object like this:

```javascript
// script.js

// Simple Module Import
// import './shoppingCart.js';

// Named Import
// import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js';

// Renaming an import using `as` keyword
// import { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

// addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(price, tq);

console.log('Importing Module');

// Importing everything using *
import * as ShoppingCart from './shoppingCart.js';

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };
```

- Basically, `ShoppingCart` will create an object containing everything that is exported from the module that we will specify in the script.js
- So, it will create a namespace for all of the value exported from that module.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When using \* to import everything from a module, the file extension is important to mentioned when importing.
>
> Otherwise, it will throw an error.
>
> So, the extension is necessary, it is only not necessary in some other cases, that we will see later.

- Now whenever we want to use something that was exported, we will have to take it from the `ShoppingCart` object, like so:

```javascript
// script.js

// Simple Module Import
// import './shoppingCart.js';

// Named Import
// import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js';

// Renaming an import using `as` keyword
// import { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

// addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(price, tq);

console.log('Importing Module');

// Importing everything using *
import * as ShoppingCart from './shoppingCart.js';

ShoppingCart.addToCart('bread', 5);
console.log(ShoppingCart.totalPrice);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };
```

- So, we got it to work.
- So, basically if we think about it, the shoppingCart.js module is now basically exporting a public API, just like a class.
- So, it is as if the `ShoppingCart` object was an object created from a class, which now has these methods, and also for example, these properties like `ShoppingCart.totalPrice`.
- Of course, we are not trying to replace classes with modules, we just want to turn your attention to the fact, that some things look pretty similar indeed.
- And actually, we can that the module export is kind of like public API, because everything else of course stays private inside of the module.
- Alright, that's basically how named imports and exports work; and also how we can export multiple values at once, and how we can change the name of the named exports, and also of the named import.
- Then we learned how we can import everything at the same time i.e. all the named imports at once using `*`.
- So, now it is time to think about default exports.
- So, as mentioned earlier, there are two types of exports v.i.z. named exports and default exports. So, let's now talk about default exports.
- Usually, we use default exports when we only want to export one thing per module, and so that's the reason why they are called default.
- It works pretty similar to named exports but, we have to write the keyword `default` along with `export` when we simply want to export a default value.
- For example, if we wanted to default export the `addToCart` function, we would simple export the value itself, not the variable, like so:

```javascript
// script.js

// Simple Module Import
// import './shoppingCart.js';

// Named Import
// import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js';

// Renaming an import using `as` keyword
// import { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

// addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(price, tq);

console.log('Importing Module');

// Importing everything using *
import * as ShoppingCart from './shoppingCart.js';

ShoppingCart.addToCart('bread', 5);
console.log(ShoppingCart.totalPrice);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };

export default function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
}
```

- Here you see that no name is involved at all.
- We are simply exporting the function value.
- So then, when we import it, we can basically give it any name we want.

```javascript
// script.js

// Simple Module Import
// import './shoppingCart.js';

// Named Import
// import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js';

// Renaming an import using `as` keyword
// import { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

// addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(price, tq);

console.log('Importing Module');

// Importing everything using *
import * as ShoppingCart from './shoppingCart.js';

ShoppingCart.addToCart('bread', 5);
console.log(ShoppingCart.totalPrice);

// Importing default value from shoppingCart.js
import add from './shoppingCart.js';

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };

export default function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
}
```

- This will then import the default export, no matter what it is called.
- Notice how we are importing the same module twice. That's not a problem, we can do it. However, usually we don't do that.
- We don't get any error but, it is not advisable to do so.
- So, let's comment out the previous part, and let's try to access the default value.

```javascript
// script.js

// Simple Module Import
// import './shoppingCart.js';

// Named Import
// import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js';

// Renaming an import using `as` keyword
// import { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

// addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(price, tq);

console.log('Importing Module');

// Importing everything using *
// import * as ShoppingCart from './shoppingCart.js';

// ShoppingCart.addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(ShoppingCart.totalPrice);

// Importing default value from shoppingCart.js
import add from './shoppingCart.js';

add('pizza', 2);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };

export default function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
}
```

- We can also have a default import and named import mixed in one import statement, like so:

```javascript
// script.js

// Simple Module Import
// import './shoppingCart.js';

// Named Import
// import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js';

// Renaming an import using `as` keyword
// import { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

// addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(price, tq);

console.log('Importing Module');

// Importing everything using *
// import * as ShoppingCart from './shoppingCart.js';

// ShoppingCart.addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(ShoppingCart.totalPrice);

// Importing default value from shoppingCart.js
// import add from './shoppingCart.js';

// Mixed named and default imports
import add, { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';

add('pizza', 2);
console.log(price);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };

export default function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
}
```

- However in practice, we usually never mix named and default exports in the same module.
- So, it is not really desirable. But, here we are doing it for learning purposes.
- So, the preferred style is actually to just use one default export per module and then import that, like we did previously.
- In fact, that is the reason why it is easier to import default exports. Since with default exports, we don't have to use the curly braces - and the designers of the specification did that on purpose.
- But of course, it is not a rigid rule so, we can dod whatever is best for any given situaton.
- However, what you probably should not do is to mix default and named exports, like we have in our example above (we are just doing it here for learning purposes).
- So, avoid that to reduce complexities.
- But, besides that, you can use named exports or default exports, whatever works best in your situations.
- Of course, we will use all of this in the real world, in our next big project. So by then, you will get a good feeling for how all of this works, a little bit better in the real world.
- But with this, you now already have a pretty good idea of how importing and exporting value between modules actually work.
- But before finishing this lesson, let's see the proof of the fact that imports are in fact, a live connection to exports. This is something that was mentioned by the end of last lesson and it is something that is really important to keep in mind, so let's take a look at it.
- To see it, we will first export the cart array from the shoppingCart.js module and import it in the script.js module.
- Then we will log it in the script.js module to see what it looks like.

```javascript
// script.js

// Simple Module Import
// import './shoppingCart.js';

// Named Import
// import { addToCart, totalPrice, totalQuantity } from './shoppingCart.js';

// Renaming an import using `as` keyword
// import { addToCart, totalPrice as price, tq } from './shoppingCart.js';

// console.log(x); // ERROR: x is not defined

// addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(price, tq);

console.log('Importing Module');

// Importing everything using *
// import * as ShoppingCart from './shoppingCart.js';

// ShoppingCart.addToCart('bread', 5);
// console.log(ShoppingCart.totalPrice);

// Importing default value from shoppingCart.js
// import add from './shoppingCart.js';

// Mixed named and default imports
import add, {
  addToCart,
  totalPrice as price,
  tq,
  cart,
} from './shoppingCart.js';

add('pizza', 2);
add('apples', 5);
console.log(price);
console.log(cart);

/************************************************************************/
// shoppingCart.js
console.log('Exporting Module');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
export const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };

export default function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
}
```

- Right now it looks as if we are exporting an empty array since, `cart` is an empty array in the shoppingCart.js module.
- But when we log it to the console in script.js module, we see that there are items already in it.
- This is because we used the `add()` function to add items to it.
- This proves that the importing of the `cart` array is not simply a copy of that array that we exported from shoppingCart.js module.
- Because if it was just a copy, then in the script.js module, we would simply just get the empty array - since that is what the `cart` variable looked like when we exported it.
- But as mentioned in the previous lesson, it is not simply a copy, it is in fact a live connection, and as we call the `add()` function, we keep pushing objects to that array.
- So, we are mutating that array in the script.js module.
- So, as we log that cart in the console, we see that manipulated array.
- So, they are in fact, the same object behind the scenes, basically.
- Hence, imports are not copies of the exports.
- This means that the `cart` array in the importing and exporting modules, i.e. in both places, points to the same place in the memory.
- Keep this in mind when you write your own code, because it can lead to bugs if you don't know what you are doing or if you don't know how it works.
- With that, we finished this lesson, which is a pretty important one as it is the foundation of how we organize a modern JS code base.
- So, make sure to review this lesson thoroughly, and play around with it some more to get comfortable with it.

### Top-Level Await (ES 2022)

- Let's now shortly go back to asynchronous JavaScript, because there has been an important change in ES 2022 version.
- We can now use the `await` keyword outside of the `async` functions, at least in modules. So, that's why this is here in the module section.
- Again, as mentioned, because this is important, we can now basically use the `await` keyword outside of an async function, which we call <ins>top-level await</ins>.
- Just remember that this only works in modules.
- If we were going to try this in a normal script, like we have been using before this section, then top-level await would still fail.
- But in the last lesson, we added the `type` attribute to our script file with its value set to `module` and that is what is really required to make top-level `await` actually work.
- So, to see the top level `await`, let's simply do a simple `fetch()` request.

```html
<script type="module" defer src="script.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// script.js

const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data);
```

- Indeed, we get our data.
- We have an array of 100 posts here, where each of them is an object.
- So, that's how we use the top-level await. Indeed, the `await` keyword is now working outside of an `async` function.
- What's really, really important to understand here is that while this is all great and very useful, it actually blocks the execution of the entire module now; and as we learned in the previous section, that is sometimes not exactly what we want.
- We can see that it is indeed a synchronous code by logging something after the `fetch()` function.

```javascript
// script.js

console.log('Start fetching');

const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data);

console.log('Something');
```

- To really see it, you can also maneuver the internet speed using the network tab in the chrome developer tools.
- In console, you will see that "Something" is only printed after the data from the API has arrived.
- So in fact, the `await` keyword - which is now outside of an async function, is blocking the entire execution of this module - which is something that we had never seen before.
- So, this really wasn't possible before we got top-level `await` in JS.
- Of course, this can be useful in some situations but, many times, it can also be harmful, and especially if it is a really long running task.
- Long story short, make sure you use this new superpower with great caution.
- This example illustrates exactly how the top-level `await` works, but it is a bit too simple. It is not really real-world enough.
- So, let's get more real.
- Many times, we have a situation where we do have an async function that want to return some data.

```javascript
// script.js

console.log('Start fetching');

const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data);

console.log('Something');

/**
 * This function will basically do a fetch request to the same URL above,
 * but it will only return the very last post.
 */
const getLastPost = async function () {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);
};

getLastPost();
```

- Now we want to return something from the `getLastPost()` function. So, we want to simply return an object which contains the title and body of the post.

```javascript
// script.js

console.log('Start fetching');

const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data);

console.log('Something');

/**
 * This function will basically do a fetch request to the same URL above,
 * but it will only return the very last post.
 */
const getLastPost = async function () {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);

  return { title: data.at(-1).title, text: data.at(-1).body };
};

const lastPost = getLastPost();
console.log(lastPost);
```

- Now if you have studied that last section, then you will remember that the returning value which is stored in `lastPost` is actually going to be a promise, and not the object that we were expecting.
- The reason for that is that calling an `async` function will always return the actual data itself, because by the time we are running this line of code: `const lastPost = getLastPost()`, the data has not arrived yet.
- So, we still have that pending promise.
- And again, if you don't really remember the specifics here, you can always go back to the last section.
- The workaround to get the actual data instead of promises is to simply use regular promises.
- So, we can simply take the promise that is stored in the variable `lastPost` and on that, we can use the `then()` method.
- In the `then()` method, we get access to the resolved value, which we can simply log to the console.

```javascript
// script.js

console.log('Start fetching');

const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data);

console.log('Something');

/**
 * This function will basically do a fetch request to the same URL above,
 * but it will only return the very last post.
 */
const getLastPost = async function () {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);

  return { title: data.at(-1).title, text: data.at(-1).body };
};

const lastPost = getLastPost();
console.log(lastPost);

lastPost.then(last => console.log(last));
```

- So, after some time, we get the object that we want.
- However, doing this is not very clean, so what we can do now is to use top-level await for it.

```javascript
// script.js

console.log('Start fetching');

const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data);

console.log('Something');

/**
 * This function will basically do a fetch request to the same URL above,
 * but it will only return the very last post.
 */
const getLastPost = async function () {
  const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`);
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);

  return { title: data.at(-1).title, text: data.at(-1).body };
};

const lastPost = getLastPost();
console.log(lastPost);

// not very clean
// lastPost.then(last => console.log(last));

const lastPost2 = await getLastPost();
console.log(lastPost2);
```

- After some time, we get the result that we wanted.
- So, it is situations like this where top-level `await` can actually get quite useful.
- Now to finish, let's see one more important implication of using top-level `await` and that is the fact that if one module imports a module which has a top-level await, then the importing module will wait for the imported module to finish the blocking code.
- That may sound a bit complicated than it actually is. So, let's just demostrate it with an example.
- For demonstration, in the shoppingCart.js module, let's add some blocking code in the very beginning.

```javascript
// shoppingCart.js

console.log('Exporting Module');

// Adding a blocking code to see that the importing module will wait for
// this to finish
console.log('Start fetching users');
await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
console.log('Finish fetching users');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
export const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };

export default function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
}
```

- Note that you can change the speed of the internet using the network tab in chrome developer tools to see it in action.
- Now if we go back to our script.js module, the first thing that is going to happen is that the shoppingCart.js is going to be imported.
- Then we immediately start fetching the users.
- Then, only after the fetch is completed, we get the second log of "Finish fetching users".
- And only after that we get the code executed in the importing module.
- So, the code in script.js actually has to wait for the code in shoppingCart.js to finish.
- So, the top-level `await` in the shoppingCart.js module is in fact not only blocking the code in its own module but also, in the module that is importing it.
- So, it is really important to remember that using the top-level `await` will block the entire module in a way that really could block code execution.
- So, this is not only a really helpful tool, but also one that we need to use with great care.
- So, let's comment out this code so it won't block when we build more in the same files, going into next lessons.

```javascript
// shoppingCart.js

console.log('Exporting Module');

// Adding a blocking code to see that the importing module will wait for
// this to finish
// console.log('Start fetching users');
// await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
// console.log('Finish fetching users');

const x = 0;
const shippingCost = 10;
export const cart = [];

export const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
};

const totalPrice = 237;
const totalQuantity = 23;

export { totalPrice, totalQuantity as tq };

export default function (product, quantity) {
  cart.push({ product, quantity });
  console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
}
```

- This is how top-level await works.
- So, let's now go straight to the next lesson.

### The Module Pattern

- Now that you know how ES6 modules work, let's quickly see the module pattern that we used to use before in order to implement modules in JS.
- It is important to understand this module pattern because you will still see it around, and it is also a very good application of many of the stuff that we have been learning throughout the course.
- of course, just like in regular modules that we just learned about, the main goal of the module pattern is to encapsulate functionality, to have private data, and to expose a public API.
- The best way of achieving all that is by simply using functions, because functions give us private data by default and allows us to return values, which can become our public API.
- So, let's see how the module pattern is implemented.
- We start by writing a function and usually we write an IIFE, and the reason for that is because this way we don't have to call it separately and we can also ensure that it is only called once.

```javascript
// script.js

(function () {})();
```

- So, it is very important that this function is only created once because the goal of this function i snot to re-use code by running it multiple times.
- The only purpose of this function is to create a new scope and return data just once.
- In this function, let's simply add the same variables that we had before in the shoppingCart.js module.

```javascript
// script.js

(function () {
  const cart = [];
  const shippingCost = 10;
  const totalPrice = 237;
  const totalQuantity = 23;

  const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
    cart.push({ product, quantity });
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
  };

  const orderStock = function (product, quantity) {
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} ordered from supplier`);
  };
})();
```

- Right now, of course, all of this data is private because it is inside of the scope of the function.
- So now, all we have to do is to return some of this stuff in order to basically return a public API.
- To do that, we simply return an object, which contains the stuff that we want to make public.

```javascript
// script.js

(function () {
  const cart = [];
  const shippingCost = 10;
  const totalPrice = 237;
  const totalQuantity = 23;

  const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
    cart.push({ product, quantity });
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
  };

  const orderStock = function (product, quantity) {
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} ordered from supplier`);
  };

  return {
    addToCart,
    cart,
    totalPrice,
    totalQuantity,
  };
})();
```

- We could have also defined all of these exports in an object as properties and methods but, it is little bit cleaner to define them outside and then to simply create an object which contains everything that we want to expose to the outside (like we did above).
- However, right now we are not storing this object anywhere.
- So, if we run this script right now, then this object kind of disappears into nothing.
- However, that is easy to fix because, we can simply assign the result of running this IIFE to a new variable.

```javascript
// script.js

const ShoppingCart2 = (function () {
  const cart = [];
  const shippingCost = 10;
  const totalPrice = 237;
  const totalQuantity = 23;

  const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
    cart.push({ product, quantity });
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
  };

  const orderStock = function (product, quantity) {
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} ordered from supplier`);
  };

  return {
    addToCart,
    cart,
    totalPrice,
    totalQuantity,
  };
})();
```

- Now, we can use the `ShoppingCart2` just like before.

```javascript
// script.js

const ShoppingCart2 = (function () {
  const cart = [];
  const shippingCost = 10;
  const totalPrice = 237;
  const totalQuantity = 23;

  const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
    cart.push({ product, quantity });
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
  };

  const orderStock = function (product, quantity) {
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} ordered from supplier`);
  };

  return {
    addToCart,
    cart,
    totalPrice,
    totalQuantity,
  };
})();

ShoppingCart2.addToCart('apples', 4);
ShoppingCart2.addToCart('bananas', 3);

console.log(ShoppingCart2.cart);
```

- Indeed, it works.

- On the other hand, the properties that we wanted to make private and not accessible. So, we cannot access `shippingCost` outside of the function.

```javascript
// script.js

const ShoppingCart2 = (function () {
  const cart = [];
  const shippingCost = 10;
  const totalPrice = 237;
  const totalQuantity = 23;

  const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
    cart.push({ product, quantity });
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart`);
  };

  const orderStock = function (product, quantity) {
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} ordered from supplier`);
  };

  return {
    addToCart,
    cart,
    totalPrice,
    totalQuantity,
  };
})();

ShoppingCart2.addToCart('apples', 4);
ShoppingCart2.addToCart('bananas', 3);

console.log(ShoppingCart2.cart);
console.log(ShoppingCart2.shippingCost); // undefined
```

- That's actually it.
- That's the implementation of the module pattern.
- Now, do you understand exactly how and why this works? Meaning, how do we, for example, have access to the `cart` variable outside the function and even able to manipulate it? How are we able to do that even if the IIFE has returned long ago?
- So, this IIFE function was only executed once in the beginning and all it did was to return an object and assigned it to the variable `ShoppingCart2`.
- But then we are able to use all of those variables and also manipulate the data that is inside of the IIFE function.
- The answer to how all of this works like this is one more time, closures.
- Remember that closures allow a function to have access to all the variables that were present at its birthplace.
- So, the `addToCart()` function was created in the IIFE function. So the IIFE function is the birthplace of the `addToCart()` function.
- Therefore, the `addToCart()` function never loses connection to its birthplace, which was the IIFE function.
- This birthplace also contains the `cart`.
- Therefore, `addToCart()` function outside of the IIFE, can still access the `cart` variable that was in the IIFE function.
- So, the reason why this works is not because the `cart` variable is also in the returning object - that's irrelevant, because we are not using `this.cart` in the `addToCart()` function. We are simply using `cart`.
- So, inside the `addToCart()` function, we could also log something that is private to the module i.e. IIFE function. So, something that will not be in the exported object.

```javascript
// script.js

const ShoppingCart2 = (function () {
  const cart = [];
  const shippingCost = 10;
  const totalPrice = 237;
  const totalQuantity = 23;

  const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
    cart.push({ product, quantity });
    console.log(
      `${quantity} ${product} added to cart (shipping cost is ${shippingCost})`
    );
  };

  const orderStock = function (product, quantity) {
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} ordered from supplier`);
  };

  return {
    addToCart,
    cart,
    totalPrice,
    totalQuantity,
  };
})();

ShoppingCart2.addToCart('apples', 4);
ShoppingCart2.addToCart('bananas', 3);

console.log(ShoppingCart2.cart);
console.log(ShoppingCart2.shippingCost); // undefined
```

- So, in order to produce this string:

```javascript
console.log(
  `${quantity} ${product} added to cart (shipping cost is ${shippingCost})`
);
```

- The function will also have to use the `shippingCost` variable that was only present at its birthplace, but which no longer does exist besides that.
- Indeed, that still works, so the function is still able to access that value of 10.
- And for a deeper explanation of why this works, you can, of course, always go back and re-visit the lesson about closures.
- In essence, this is how the module pattern works and it works very well.
- It has been working for a long time for developers i.e. long before ES6 modules even existed in JS.
- Now, the problem is that if we wanted one module per file - like we have with ES6 modules, then we would have to create different scripts and link all of them in the HTML file.
- That then creates a couple of problems, like we have to be careful with the order in which we declare then in HTML, and we would have all of the variables living in the global scope, and finally, we also couldn't bundle them together using a module bundler.
- So, as you learned at the beginning of this section, using a module bundler is very important in modern JS.
- So the module pattern that we just learned about does indeed work quite good but, it has some limitations; and that's exactly the reason why native modules were added to the language in ES6.
