# Mapty App: OOP, Geolocation, External Libraries, and More!

**About:** Welcome to our next project and this one is going to be the coolest, most real-world project thus far. We are going to apply everything that we have learned so far, including advanced concepts such as functions, arrays, and object oriented programming. We will also learn some new things like how to use geolocation and how to use third party libraries in our project. Even more importantly, you will actually learn how to plan a project, because building a project is not just writing some code, it is also about thinking and taking decisions and solving problems. It is important to learn that so that eventually, you can build projects on your own.

## Project Overview

- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/8dc757e1-2aee-4421-93d1-2a303adf0821)
- This is the [Mapty Application](https://bhoamikhona.github.io/javascript/Section%2015/index.html).
- We have a sidebar on the left and the main part of this application is the huge map.
- This map is loaded from a third party service. Also, the position is automatically obtained by the browser using geolocation.
- When you first load the webpage, the application will ask you if you'd like to allow for it to know your location.
- Once you click allow, JS will fetch your positon and it will then also load the map on your current position.
- The goal of this application is for the user to log their workouts.
- Once you click somewhere on the map, a form will appear on the left sidebar where you can input what kind of activity you did and its details.
- Once you submit the form, the details will be printed nicely on the sidebar along with a pop-up/pin on the map.
- We can add as many workouts as we like on the app.
- Let's say we have activities all over the place so, what's cool about this is that we can click on any activity on displayed on the sidebar and it will automatically move the map to that workout.
- Another thing that is special here is that when we close this app or re-load it, it retains all the data i.e. it maintains its state.
- Essentially, this data about the workouts is going to be stored in the browser and then each time we load this webpage, we will read the data from the browser.
