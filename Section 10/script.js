 * so the number of passengers is now 1000.
 *
 * So, if we want to skip an argument when calling a function, the trick

 *
 * Example:
 */

 * This works because setting the parameter to `undefined` is the same

 * meaning that if we don't even pass an argument into that parameter
 * it by default, takes the value of `undefined`.
 *
 * So, explicitly setting it to `undefined` is exactly the same as not
 * even setting the value of the parameter.
 *
 * So, this is how we basically skip a default parameter that we want to
 * leave at its default.
 *
 * So, if we reload and check the console, we will see that the result
 * of above function call is that we now indeed have the price set to 1000
 * and the numPassengers set to 1 (which is the default that we set in
 * the function).
 *
 * So, default parameters are yet another very nice addition to the
 * language in ES6 and pretty straightforward to understand too.

/**
 * If we check the console, we will find that our flight number is still
 * LH234 - which is exactly as we defined it before the checkIn()
 * function, even though it seems like it was re-defined inside the
 * function - it really wasn't.
 *
 * After the flight, we also get the `bhoami` object but, the name
 * inside the `bhoami` object is changed to "Ms.Bhoami Khona" - this
 * change was made inside the function.
 *
 * Let's analyze what happened here.
 *
 * The flightNum is a primitive type - it is just a string and as we
 * passed that value into the function (when we called the function),
 * the flight number there is basically just a copy of the original
 * value.
 *
 * So, flightNum - the argument contains the copy of the variable
 * flightNum. So, the flightNum argument is a copy of the orginal value,
 * it is not the orginal value of the flightNum variable.
 *
 * So, flightNum is a completely different varaible than the argument that
 * we passed in. Therefore, as we change the flightNum argument's value
 * inside the checkIn() function, it is not reflected outside, in the
 * original flightNum variable - which is why the original flightNum
 * variable is still "LH234", exactly for the same reason as we saw before
 * in the primitives vs. reference types lesson.
 *
 * But now what about the `bhoami` object that we passed into the
 * checkIn() function? In the checkIn() function, the `bhoami` object
 * is referred to as "passenger".
 *
 * In the function we changed the `passenger` object and as we then saw,
 * the original `bhoami` object was also affecter by that change. So,
 * why did that happen?
 *
 * When we pass a reference type to a function, what is really copied
 * is reall just a reference to the object in the memory heap.
 *
 * So, that would be exactly like doing this: `const passenger = bhoami`.
 * As you already know, when we try to copy an object like this, we are
 * really only copying the reference to that object in the memeory
 * heap, but they both point to the same object in the memory.
 *
 * That's exactly what is also happening here, with the `bhoami` object,
 * as we pass it into the checkIn() funtion where it is called passenger.
 *
 * So, inside the checkIn() function, as we are manipulating the passenger
 * object, it is exactly the same as manipulating the `bhoami` object.
 * This is because, they both are the same object in the memory heap.
 *
 * In summary, passing a primitive type to a function is really just
 * the same as creating a copy like this: `const flightNum = flight`,
 * outside of the function. So, the value is simply copied.
 *
 * On the other hand, when we pass an object to a function, it is really
 * just like copying an object like this: `const passenger = bhoami`.
 *
 * So, whatever we change in the copy, will also happen in the original.
 *
 * Now, of course, we need to be careful with this behavior and always
 * keep it in mind. This is because the fact that objects behave this
 * way when passed to functions can have un-forseeable consequences in
 * large code bases. This is especially true when you are working with
 * multiple developers.
 *
 * Let's write another quick function here to see what can happen, in
 * order to prepare you for real-life.
 *
 * Let's just create a function called newPassport(). It will accept
 * any person and basically, it will simply change that person's passport
 * number.

 * Let's call the newPassport() function with `bhoami` object.
 *
 * Let's say that I booking the flight with my original passport number
 * that is already defined in the original `bhoami` object. So, the
 * original passport number will be then used to compare my passport to
 * inside the checkIn() function.
 *
 * But now, I change my passport before I checkIn().
 *
 * So, let's see what happens then.
 */
newPassport(bhoami);
checkIn(flight, bhoami);

/**
 * If we check the console now, it says "wrong password". So, what is
 * happening now is that we have two function manipulating the same

 *
 * In the newPassport() function, I am passing in an object, and that
 * object is called `person` inside the newPassport() function. As the
 * function manipulates that `person` object, it also gets reflected in
 * the original `bhoami` object.
 *
 * Now as we pass that `bhoami` object in the checkIn() function, the
 * passport is no longer the same as the original one.
 *
 * This is a good example of how the interaction of different functions
 * with the same object can create some issues.
 *
 * Of course this is just a simple example but, I'm sure you get the
 * point.
 *
 * What matters is that you are aware of this issue and then you can

/**
 * In programming, there are two terms that are used all the time when

 *
 * Many experienced programmers that are new to JavaScript have some

 * let's quickly address that here.
 *
 * JavaScript does not have passing by reference, it only has passing

 *
 * So, there are languages like C++, where you can pass a reference to
 * any value, instead of the value itself. This works even with
 * primitives. So, you could pass a reference to the value of 5, and
 * then the original value, outside of the function, would be changed.
 * This is called "Pass by Reference".
 *
 * But, once again, JavaScript does not have pass by reference.
 *
 * So, if you already know some programming, but are new to JavaScript,
 * be sure to understand it.
 *
 * This is confusing because, because as we just learned, for objects,
 * we do infact pass in a reference, which is the memory address of the
 * object. However, that reference itself is still a value. It is simply
 * a value that contains a memory address.
 *
 * Basically, we pass a reference to the function, but we do not pass
 * by reference, and this is an important distiction.
 */

/**
Explanation

When we pass a primitive type as an argument on a function, the function makes a copy of the original value, and works with it.

When we pass an object as an argument on a function, the function makes a copy of the reference that points to the place of the memory where the object is stored. This copy is a value itself, is not a reference. Through this value, the original object can be modified from inside of a function.



Summary

- In programming languages, Arguments can be passed by value, or passed by reference.

- JavaScript works only passing by value.

- When we pass primitive values, the function works with a value, which is a copy of the original value.

- When we pass an object, the function works with a value, which is a copy of the reference that address to the spot in the memory where the original object is in the memory (still is not a reference).

 */

transformer('JavaScript is the best!', oneWord); // javascriptisthebest!

/**
 * Let's recap:
 *
 * We are calling the transformer function and into that function, we are
 * passing the callback function.
 *
 * Remember that the functions we pass in as arguments are called
 * callback functions and that's because we do not call them ourselves
 * but instead, we tell JavaScript to basically call them later.
 *
 * In our case, calling them later happens inside the transformer()
 * function. The callback functions inside the transformer() function is
 * called `fn` so, we have to use fn() to call those functions inside
 * transformer().
 *
 * In fact, this is exactly the same idea that we already talked about,
 * using the addEventListener() function.
 *
 * Let's say that we have this very simple function called highFive()
 * which doesn't really do much except of logging something to the
 * console.
 */

const highFive = function () {
  console.log('👋');
};

document.body.addEventListener('click', highFive);

/**
 * Just like our transformer function, we pass in a callback function
 * in the addEventListener() function.
 *
 * The callback function in the case of addEventListener() is also
 * called the event handler or event listener but, that doesn't really
 * matter.
 *
 * What matters is that conceptually, the argument function `highFive` is
 * the callback function and the addEventListener() function is the
 * higher order function.
 *
 * So, it is just a callback function that JS will call whenever we
 * click on the body.
 *
 * There are many other examples in the JavaScript language; and this
 * concept of callback functions is used all the time in built-in JS
 * functions.
 *
 * So, there are many more examples, for example the forEach() function
 * that we call on arrays:
 */

// NOTE: We will learn about forEach() in the next section
['Bhoami', 'Jonas', 'Janine'].forEach(highFive);

/**
 * If we check the console now, we will find that the highFive() function
 * was executed 3 times. That's because we have 3 elements in the array
 * on which we called the forEach() method. But, we will learn about the
 * forEach() method in the next section.
 *
 * What matters here is that once again, we use the concept of the
 * callback function here.
 *
 * This is something that is really common in JavaScript.
 *
 * Let's now take a minute or two to understand why that is. Why are
 * callback functions so much used in JavaScript and why are they so
 * helpful?
 *
 * The first big advantage of this is that it makes it each to split up
 * our code into more re-usable and interconnected parts.
 *
 * The second and way more important advantage is the fact that callback
 * functions allow us to create abstraction.
 *
 * Let's understand what that means.
 *
 * What we did in our transformer example was to create a level of
 * abstraction and abstraction is something that is really important in
 * programming.
 *
 * Basically, what abstraction means is that we hide the detail of some
 * code implementation because we don't really care about all that detail.
 *
 * This allows us to think about problems at a higher more abstract level.
 * That's why it is called an abstration.
 *
 * Coming back to our tranformer example, the transformer() function
 * does not care at all how the string is transformed. It doesn't care
 * about that level of detail.
 *
 * All that it wants to do is to transform a string, but doesn't care
 * how it should do it.
 *
 * What we mean here is that we could have easily taken the code from
 * oneWord() function or upperFirstWord() function and directly placed
 * it inide the transformer() function but instead, we abstracted those
 * codes away into other functions.
 *
 * So, we created a new level of abstraction and by doing that our main
 * transformer() function is really only concerned with transforming the
 * input string itself but, it doesn't matter how the transforming
 * actually works.
 *
 * Basically, it is delegating the string transformation to the other
 * lower level of functions, which are oneWord() and upperFirstWord().
 *
 * Hope this makes sense and we will also come back to this idea of
 * abstraction later when we talk about object oriented programming.
 *
 * But, it is good for you think and talk about it as soon as possible,
 * so that you can start to get an idea of this really important concept
 * of abstraction.
 *
 * Now, with this idea of abstraction and higher levels and lower levels
 * of abstraction, it makes sense that the kind of transformer() function
 * is, is called a higher-order function.
 *
 * Again, that's because functions like transformer() operates at a higher
 * level of abstraction, leaving the low-level details to the low-level
 * functions.
 *
 * NOTE: They are not really called lower-order or low-level functions
 * but, that just makes sense in this kind of a circumstance.
 *
 * Understand this is absolutely crucial for your process. In fact, this
 * lesson could be considered one of the most important lessons in the
 * course. This is because callback functions are really, a vital part
 * of the JavaScript language. That's one of the main takeaways from this
 * lesson.
 *
 * They allow us to create the kind of logic that we used in our
 * transformer() function so, it is good idea to review this lesson
 * thoroughly and maybe even write your own example of something that
 * you see in the real world using the same concept.
 *
 * In the built-in functions like addEventListener() and forEach(),
 * these callback functions are very important and useful because we
 * use them to tell addEventListener() and forEach() what exactly they
 * should do.
 *
 * For example, the addEventListener() function on its own would have
 * no idea of what to do whenever the click event happens. That's why
 * we pass in the callback function to tell the addEventListener()
 * function exactly what to do.
 */
