# Section 10: A Close Look At Functions

**About:** Functions are one of the most fundamental building blocks of any Javascript program. So, let's now turn our attention back to functions because, there is a lot that we don't know yet about them. In this section, we are going to study some quite advanced topics, such as higher order functions to bind method and also closure. It is crucial that you understand these topics before moving on to future sections.

## Lessons Learned

### Default Parameters

- Setting default values for function parameters before ES6, using short circuit
- Setting default values for function parameters after ES6
- You can override the default values set in the after ES6 method.
- The default values can contain expressions since expressions produce values.
- We can use the values of other parameters that were set before it, to set the default value of the current parameter.
- We cannot skip arguments of a function when we try to call it.
- If we want to leave 'middle' arguments so, they can have default values, we can set them to `undefined` because, setting them to `undefined` is the same thing as not even setting them.
