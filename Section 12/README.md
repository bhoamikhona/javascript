# Section 12: Numbers, Dates, Intl, and Timers

**About:** Over the last few sections, we have learned all about common Javascript data structures and strings but now, it is time to turn our attention onto two additional ways of representing data: numbers and dates. These might be a bit less important than things like strings and arrays but, you should still know how to use them. So, in this section, we will continue working on the Bankist App, but now we will incorporate numbers, dates, and also internalization, and timers, which are another two very important aspects that you should know about.
