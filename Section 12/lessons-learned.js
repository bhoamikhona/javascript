 * Let's start this section by learning how numbers work in JavaScript,
 * how to convert values to numbers and also how check if certain values
 * are numbers or not.
 *
 * The first thing that you should know about numbers is that in

 * numbers i.e. as decimals even if we write them as integers.
 */

console.log(23 === 23.0); // true

/**
 * That's the reason why we only have one data type for all numbers.
 *
 * Also, numbers are represented internally in a 64 base 2 format. This
 * means that numbers are always stored in a binary format.
 *
 * Basically, they are only composed of 0s and 1s.
 *
 * In this binary form, it is very hard to represent some fractions that
 * are very easy to represent in the base 10 system that we are used to.
 *
 * Base 10 is basically the numbers from 0 to 9 while binary is 0 and 1.
 *
 * As mentioned before, there are certain numbers that are very difficult
 * to represent in base 2 and one example of that is the fraction 0.1
 *
 * That then results in very weird results like this:
 */

console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004

/**
 * This is kind of a classic or a running joke in JavaScript because this
 * result of 0.30000000000000004 should, of course, be 0.3 and not with
 * all the extra 0s.
 *
 * But JavaScript simply has no better way of representing these numbers.
 *
 * In base 10, 1/10 is simply 0.1 and that is very easy to represent.
 * But, for example, if we were trying to do 3/10 then that is also
 * impossible to represent for us. The result of 3/10 would be
 * 3.3333333... until inifinity.
 *
 * So in binary, the same thing happens with 0.1
 *
 * We basically get an inifinite fraction with 0.3 which then results
 * in this weird result of 0.30000000000000004
 *
 * In some cases, JavaScript does some rounding behind the scenes to try
 * its best to hide these problems but some operations, such as 0.1 + 0.3
 * JS simply cannot mask the fact that behind the scenes, they cannot
 * represent certain fractions.
 *
 * By the way, many other languages use the same system, for example,
 * PHP or Ruby so don't let anyone make fun of JavaScript because of this.
 *
 * We just have to accept that it works this way because we really cannot
 * do anything against it.
 *
 * So just be aware that you cannot do precise scientific or financial
 * calculations in JavaScript because eventually, you will run into a
 * problem like we just did.
 */

// this is incorrect but, it is an error beacause JS works with binary
// behind the scenes and there is nothing we can do about it so just,
// be aware about it.
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); // false

/**
 * Now that we know how JavaScript represents numbers, let's go back
 * to actually working with them.
 *
 * We know how to convert a string to a number using the Number()
 * constructor function.
 */

console.log(Number('23')); // 23 of type number

/**
 * But there is also an easier way - it is kind of a trick really, and it
 * works like this:
 */

console.log(+'23'); // 23 of type number

/**
 * So we just add a `+` operator before the string.
 *
 * This works because when JavaScript sees the plus operator, it will do
 * type coercion i.e. it will automatically convert all the operands to
 * numbers.
 *
 * This makes our code look a lot cleaner. So, let's go to our bankist
 * app and replace all the occurences of Number() with the `+` sign.
 * So head over to the script.js file for that.
 *
 * Our project will work the same but our code will look a little bit
 * cleaner now.
 */

/**
 * So above, we converted strings to numbers but, we can also do something
 * called parsing.
 *
 * We can parse a number from a string.
 *
 * On the `Number` object, which is kind of this function `Number()` but,
 * it is also an object in the end because in JavaScript, every function
 * is also an object.
 *
 * So, on this `Number` object, we have some methods to do parsing.
 * So, let's use `parseInt()`. Within `parseInt()`, we pass a string and
 * this string can even include some symbols.
 *
 * JavaScript will then automatically try to figure out the number that is
 * in this string.
 */

console.log(Number.parseInt('30px')); // 30 of type number

/**
 * In order to make `parseInt()` work, the string needs to start with
 * a number. If we start with anything else, it will not work. We will
 * instead get `NaN`.
 */

console.log(Number.parseInt('e23')); // NaN

/**
 * So, this is a little bit like type coercion but even more advanced
 * because as we just saw, it tries to get rid of unnecessary symbols that
 * are not numbers.
 *
 * This can be very useful in situations like "30px" where we get some
 * kind of unit from CSS and then need to get rid of that unit.
 *
 * Now, the `parseInt()` function actually accepts a second argument,
 * which is the so-called regex.
 *
 * The regex is the base of the numeral system that we are using. In our
 * examples above of `parseInt()` we are using base 10 numbers i.e.
 * numbers from 0 to 9; and most of the time, we do use base 10 numbers.
 *
 * So, we should always pass in the number 10 as the second argument, like
 * so:
 */

console.log(Number.parseInt('30px', 10)); // 30 of type number

/**
 * This will help avoid some bugs in some situations; and as you will see,
 * the result is the same.
 *
 * But, if we were working, for example, with binary, then the result
 * will be comletely different.
 */

// passing base 2 as the second argument i.e. binary
console.log(Number.parseInt('30px', 2)); // NaN
console.log(Number.parseInt('101px', 2)); // 5 of type number

/**
 * This was with integers and that's what the "Int" stands for in
 * `parseInt()` but, there is also `parseFloat()`.
 */

console.log(Number.parseInt('2.5rem')); // 2 of type number
console.log(Number.parseFloat('2.5rem')); // 2.5 of type number

/**
 * Now it reads the decimal point number from our string. If we used
 * `parseInt()`, it only reads the part before the decimal point.
 *
 * By the way, we could also have white spaces before and after the
 * string but, that would not affect parseInt() or parseFloat().
 */

console.log(Number.parseInt('    23.2px   ', 10)); // 23 of type number
console.log(Number.parseFloat('    23.2px   ', 10)); // 23.2 of type number

/**
 * parseInt() and parseFloat() are also so-called global functions. So,

 *
 * This would also work:
 */

console.log(parseInt('2.5rem'));
console.log(parseFloat('2.5rem'));

/**
 * But simply calling `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()` is an old-school
 * way of doing it. In modern JavaScript, it is more encouraged to call
 * these functions on Number object like so: `Number.parseInt()` and
 * `Number.parseFloat()`.
 *
 * We say that the `Number` provides something called a namespace. So,
 * a namespace for all these different functions like parseInt() and
 * parseFloat().
 *
 * Anyway, let's explore another function of the Number namespace and
 * that is the `isNaN()`.
 *
 * We can use it to check if any value is a number. Well, not any value
 * but, more about that later.
 */

// is 20 NaN? -> false
console.log(Number.isNaN(20)); // false

// here we also get false because the string "20" is just a regular value,
// it is not NaN.
console.log(Number.isNaN('20')); // false

/**
 * Now let's try it by converting something. If we convert the string
 * "20X" to a number then what happens?
 */

// we get true here, this is because when we try to convert "20X" to a
// number, we get NaN
console.log(Number.isNaN(+'20X')); // true
console.log(+'20X'); // NaN

/**
 * Let's try something else. Let's, for example, divide 23 by 0. Maybe
 * you know that dividing any number by 0 gives us inifinite i.e. dividing
 * by 0 is not allowed in Math.
 *
 * But, infinity is not NaN so, we get false.
 *
 * NOTE: Infinity is a special value that also exists in JavaScript
 */

console.log(23 / 0); // Infinity
console.log(Number.isNaN(23 / 0)); // false

/**
 * So, this `isNaN()` is not a perfect way for checking if a value is a
 * number because it doesn't consider this `Infinity` use case and
 * sometimes, this might very well happen.
 *
 * Therefore, there is a better method called `isFinite()`. So, let's try
 * that one with the same examples.
 */

// this is true because 20 is of type number and it is finite
console.log(Number.isFinite(20)); // true

// this is false because string "20" is not of type number
console.log(Number.isFinite('20')); // false

// this is false because converting "20X" string to number results in NaN
console.log(Number.isFinite(+'20X')); // false

// this is false because it results in Infinity which is the opposite of
// finite and that is also where the name of the function comes from i.e.
// isFinite()
console.log(Number.isFinite(23 / 0)); // false

/**
 * Basically, the result of isFinite() should be the opposite of isNaN()
 * because isNaN() was check if the value passed was NaN, whereas
 * isFinite() checks if the value is finite or not.
 *
 * We also get a `false` when we pass in string "20" in isFinite() because
 * it also checks the type of the value that is passed.
 *
 * Now, all this may sound a bit confusing but, just know that isFinite()
 * is indeed the best way of checking if a value is a number; and by
 * number we also mean a real number i.e. value of type number, not a
 * string.
 *
 * So, isFinite() method is the ultimate method that you should use to
 * check if any value is a number, at least when you are working with
 * floating point numbers.
 *
 * So, if you are sure that you just need to check for an integer, then
 * you can use `isInteger()` as well.
 *
 * You should only use isNaN() if you want to check whether the value is
 * literally NaN.
 */

console.log(Number.isInteger(23)); // true
console.log(Number.isInteger(23.0)); // true
console.log(Number.isInteger(23.2)); // false
console.log(Number.isInteger(23 / 0)); // false

/**
 * Now, in our project that we are currently building, there is not really
 * a need to check if any of the input is really a number or not and so,
 * in this particular case, we don't need to go back and change anything
 * but, it is still good to know about all this, especially the isFinite()
 * method.
 *
 * The isFinite() method should be your go-to method whenever you need
 * to check if something is a number or not.
 *
 * And parseFloat() should be your go-to whenever you need to read a value
 * out of a string, for example, coming from CSS.

 * BigInt is a special type of integer that was introduced in ES2020 so,
 * let's quickly take a look at it.
 *
 * In the first lesson of this section we learned that numbers are
 * represented internally as 64 bits. This means that there are exactly
 * 64 ones and zeros to represent any given number.
 *
 * Of these 64 bits, only 53 are used to actually store digits themselves.
 * The rest are for storing the position of the decimal point and the
 * sign.
 *
 * If there are only 53 bits to store the number, that means that there is
 * a limit of how big numbers can be, and we can calculate that number.
 *
 * To calculate that, we can do 2 raised to 53 minus 1. We subtract 1
 * because numbers start from 0; and it is 2 because we are working with
 * base 2 numbers i.e. binary.
 */

console.log(2 ** 53 - 1); // 9007199254740991

/**
 * This gigantic number 9007199254740991 is essentially the biggest
 * number that JavaScript can safely represent.
 *
 * This number is so important that it is even stored into the number
 * namespace as MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
 */

console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER); // 9007199254740991

/**
 * Any number that is larger than MAX_SAFE_INTEGER is not safe. This means
 * that it cannot be represented accurately.
 *
 * For example:
 */

console.log(2 ** 53 + 0); // 9007199254740992

// it should have added 2 to 9007199254740991 here but, it only added 1 to the number
console.log(2 ** 53 + 1); // 9007199254740992

/**
 * This means that JavaScript can simply not represent these numbers
 * accurately.
 *
 * So, if we do calculations with numbers that are bigger than
 * MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, we might lose precision.
 *
 * In some numbers it does actually work because JavaScript, behind the
 * scenes uses some tricks to still represent some of the unsafe
 * numbers but, again, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
 *
 * That's why we call them unsafe numbers.
 */

console.log(2 ** 53 + 2); // 9007199254740994
console.log(2 ** 53 + 3); // 9007199254740996
console.log(2 ** 53 + 4); // 9007199254740996

/**
 * This can be a problem sometimes because in some situations we might
 * need really, really big numbers. Way bigger than the ones above - for
 * example, for database IDs or when interacting with real 60 bit numbers.
 *
 * These 60 bit numbers are actually used in other languages.
 *
 * So, we might, for example, from some API, get a number that is larger
 * than the ones above. Then we have no way of storing that in JavaScript.
 * Atleast, not until 2019 because starting from ES 2020, a new primitive
 * was added, which is called BigInt.
 *
 * BigInt stands for big integers and it can be used to store numbers as
 * large as we want.
 */

// this probably does not have precision because it is larger than MAX_SAFE_INTEGER

/**
 * The `n` at the end basically transforms the number into a bigInt
 * number.
 *
 * So, it is a huge number but now, JavaScript has a way of finally
 * displaying it accurately.
 *
 * We can also create BigInt by using the BigInt function.

/**
 * Using the BigInt() function gives us a similar result, but not the
 * same because JavaScript will first have to still represent the

 * That's the reason the second number is a bit different.
 *
 * So, BigInt() should really be used only for small numbers.
 */

 * application.
 *
 * Dates and time can be a little messy and confusing in JavaScript but,
 * we will try to make the fundamentals as clear as possible.
 *
 * First, we need to create a date and there are exactly 4 ways of
 * creating dates in JavaScript.
 *
 * They all use the new Date() constructor function, but they can
 * accept different parameters. So, let's see how.
 */

// Create Date

/**
 * The first way of creating a date is to use the Date() constructor
 * with the `new` keyword and we can then assign it to a variable.
 */

let now = new Date();
console.log(now); // Wed Apr 03 2024 23:26:05 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

/**
 * We get the current date and time at this very moment.
 *
 * The second method of creating a date is to parse the date from a date
 * string.
 */

console.log(new Date('Aug 02 2020 18:05:41')); // Sun Aug 02 2020 18:05:41 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)
console.log(new Date('December 24, 2015')); // Thu Dec 24 2015 00:00:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

/**
 * So, simply providing a string - it will then automatically parse
 * the time based on that.
 *
 * So, JavaScript is pretty smart in parsing out the string that we
 * provide in the parentheses.
 *
 * However, it is generally not a good idea to do this because it can
 * be quite unreliable. However, if the string was actually created by
 * JavaScript itself, then of course it is pretty safe.
 *
 * Let's try to parse one of the dates string in our accounts object.
 * This will work because it was JavaScript who created these dates.
 * NOTE: The Z in the date means UTC i.e. Coordinated Universal Time,
 * which is basically the time without any time zone in London and also
 * without daylight savings.
 */

console.log(new Date(account1.movementsDates[0]));

/**
 * That was based on a string but, we can also pass in year, month, day,
 * hour, minute, and even second in this constructor.
 */

// You might have noticed that we put the value of month as 10 but, we
// got November which is the 11th month of the year. This means that
// months are 0 based in JavaScript.

/**
 * What's cool about this is that JavaScript auto corrects the date.
 *
 * So, let's try that again differently. Let's try Nov 31st but, we
 * already know that November only has 30 days.
 *
 * So, if we take a look at our result below, we get the corrected
 * result.
 */

/**
 * So this is sometimes pretty useful.
 *
 * Finally, we can also pass into the date constructor function, the
 * amount of milliseconds passed since the beginning of the Unix time,
 * which is January 1, 1970.
 *
 * So, let's see that:
 */

// 0 milliseconds after the first Unix time
console.log(new Date(0)); // Thu Jan 01 1970 05:30:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

/**
 * This will actually be pretty useful, even though it looks a bit
 * strange.
 *
 * Let's now create a date that is 3 days after the beginning of Unix
 * time.
 */

// Days * Hours * Minutes * Seconds * Milliseconds - this is how we
// convert days to milliseconds.
// This number that we calculated here, is called a timestamp. We will
// see why this is useful, a little bit later.

console.log(new Date(timestamp)); // Sun Jan 04 1970 05:30:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

/**
 * These dates that we created above are in fact, just another type of
 * special type of object. Therefore, they have their own methods, just
 * like arrays or maps or strings.
 *
 * So, we can use those methods to get or to set components of a date.
