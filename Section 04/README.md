# Section 04: How to Navigate This Course

**About:** This is a complete Javascript course so, it covers everything and has a lot of big projects and challenges but, you don't need to go through the entire course to become a good JS developer. There are many lectures and some sections that you can safely skip. Going through the entire course is obviously the best option but, if you don't have time or just want to focus on important parts and/or on your learning goal, this section will help you navigate through the course. Details of it all is in the PDF provided.
