/**
 * In this lesson we are going to learn how to select, create, and delete
 * elements with JavaScript.
 *
 * The goal of this lesson is more to be a quick reference for you in the
 * future because these methods that we are going to see here are actually
 * way more difficult to find and to understand from the MDN
 * documentation.
 *
 * So, when you need some of these methods in the future then all you have
 * to do is to come back to this lesson and see how it works.
 *
 * Let's start by learning a little bit more about selecting elements.
 */

// Selecting Elements

/**
 * We are going to start at the very top of any HTML document which is
 * `document`. So, we do have a special way of selecting the entire
 * document of any webpage by using the `documentElement` on the
 * `document`.
 *
 * So, just using `document` is not enough to select the document element
 * because that is not the real DOM element.
 *
 * For example, if we want to apply CSS styles to the entire page, we
 * need to select `documentElement`.
 */

console.log(document.documentElement); // the entire HTML element

/**
 * We can also easily select the head and the body.
 */

console.log(document.head); // head element
console.log(document.body); // body element

/**
 * So, for these special elements viz documentElement, head, and body
 * we don't even need to write any selector but, otherwise, as you already
 * know, we can use `querySelector()`.
 */

// this will return the first element that matches the passed selector
let header = document.querySelector('.header');
console.log(header);

/**
 * If we want to select multiple elements, then we should use
 * `document.querySelectorAll()`.
 */

let allSections = document.querySelectorAll('.section');
console.log(allSections);

/**
 * As you know already, the `querySelectorAll()` will return a node list
 * and then that will contain all of the elements that are a section
 * which are selected by our selector.
 *
 * These are the ones that we have been using all the time and in-fact
 * they are the most used ways of selecting elements.
 *
 * As you learned from the previous lesson, these are available not only
 * on the document i.e. `document.querySelector()` but, also on the
 * elements.
 *
 * Actually, we use this a lot when we want to select child elements as
 *  we will do a little bit later in this section.
 *
 * Next, we also already talked about `getElementById()` and within that,
 * we only pass the ID name itself without the selector.
 */

console.log(document.getElementById('section--1'));

/**
 * There also some others.
 */

const allButtons = document.getElementsByTagName('button');
console.log(allButtons);

/**
 * The `getElementsByTagName()` method returns an HTML collection, which
 * is different from a Node List because an HTML collection is actually
 * a so-called live collection.
 *
 * This means that if the DOM changes then this collection is also
 * immediately updated, automatically.
 *
 * For example, if we delete a button from the UI, and we go back to the
 * console and check for allButtons, we will find that one of them is
 * gone - which is the one that we deleted.
 *
 * So, that is something that is very important to keep in mind when we
 * use the `getElementsByTagName()` selector.
 *
 * Sometimes, it is actually quite helpful to have an HTML collection
 * like this - which updates automatically because, of course we can
 * also delete elements from the DOM programmatically, not just manually,
 * like we saw above with `allButtons`.
 *
 * The same does not happen with a NodeList.
 *
 * If we delete one of the sections from the UI, and then check
 * allSections, we will still have all the sections there, in the node
 * list.
 *
 * That's because this variable i.e. `allSections` was created by the
 * time when our deleted section still existed; and it didn't update
 * itself after one of the sections was deleted.
 *
 * So, that is important to keep in mind.
 *
 * Finally, let's also see `getElementsByClassName()`. This is similar to
 * getElementById() and getElementsByTagName().
 *
 * `getElementsByClassName()` will also return a live HTML collection.
 */

console.log(document.getElementsByClassName('btn'));

/**
 * So, this is how we select elements.
 *
 * We already knew `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` which are
 * the modern ones but, the other ones have their place as well.
 *
 * So, in case we need a live HTML collection, which in some cases it is
 * helpful, we can use getElementsByTagName() and getElementsByClassName()
 * but, most of the time, we keep using the querySelector() and
 * querySelectorAll().
 */

// Creating and Inserting Elements
/**
 * Next up, let's talk about creating and inserting elements.
 *
 * We can create HTML elements using the `insertAdjacentHTML()` function
 * that we used before in the bankist application to insert movements.
 *
 * It is a quick and easy way of creating elements that used and liked a
 * lot.
 */

let html = `<h2>
"InsertAdjacentHTML()"
</h2>`;

document
  .querySelector('.header__title')
  .insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin', html);

/**
 * But, let's now focus on some other ways of creating elements because
 * sometimes it is more useful to actually build the element a bit more
 * from scratch, like more programmatically using a combination of some
 * other methods.
 *
 * So, let's see how and then it will make sense.
 */

/**
 * Let's use the `createElement()` method. The first argument that we
 * pass into this method is the element that we want to create. For
 * example, a div.
 *
 * So, createElement('div') will return a DOM element of <div>
 *
 * So, let's create a div, and store that into a variable called message.
 */
let message = document.createElement('div');

/**
 * Now, this element is no where in our DOM yet. All it is, is a DOM
 * object that we can now use to do something on it but, it is not yet
 * in the DOM itself.
 *
 * If we want it on our page, then we need to manually insert it on our
 * page. But first, let's actually do something with it.
 *
 * For example, we can add classes to it.
 */

// now, this is like a selection for example querySelector() so, we can
// use it to select the element that we created and then do something
// with it like adding classes to it.
// Basically, `message` is just an object that represents a DOM element.
message.classList.add('cookie-message');

// we can also add text to the element
// message.textContent = 'We use cookies for improveed functionality and analytics.';
message.innerHTML =
  'We use cookies for improveed functionality and analytics. <button class="btn btn--close-cookie">Got it!</button>';

/**
 * We now have this element and all we have to do now is to insert it
 * into our DOM.
 *
 * Let's do that in our header.
 */
// header.prepend(message);

/**
 * Now indeed, it is in our DOM.
 *
 * prepend() basically adds the element as the first child of the
 * element that it is call upon.
 *
 * But, we can also add it as the last child. For that, we use append()
 */

// header.append(message);

/**
 * Now what we see here is the the element was only inserted once.
 *
 * This is because, the `message` element is now indeed a live element
 * living in the DOM. Therefore, it cannot be at multipel places at
 * the same time.
 *
 * It is just like a person that also cannot be at two place
 * simultaneously.
 *
 * So, what happened here is that we first prepended the element and then
 * we appended it. What append() did here was to basically move the
 * element from being the first child to being the last child.
 *
 * Basically, it moved the element and did'nt really insert it because
 * it was already inserted in the DOM by prepend().
 *
 * What this means is that we can use the prepend() and append() methods
 * not only to insert elements but also, to move them.
 *
 * Again, that is because a DOM element is unique. So, it can always only
 * exist at one place at a time.
 */

/**
 * But now, what if we actually wanted to insert multiple copies of the
 * same element?
 *
 * In that case, we actually would have to copy the first element.
 * To clone, we use the cloneNode() method and we pass in `true` as
 * its argument.
 *
 * So, comment out the `header.append(message)` and let's clone it, before
 * we add it to the DOM once again.
 */

// All the child elements of the `message` element will also be copied
// header.append(message.cloneNode(true));

/**
 * Now, as you see, we get the same cookie message in both places, but
 * usually this is not what we want.
 *
 * So, let's actually only append it.
 */

header.append(message);

/**
 * Now to finish, there are actually two more methods and they are
 * before() and after().
 *
 * As the name suggests, before() will insert the element before the
 * header element i.e. as a sibling; and the after() will insert the
 * element after the header element as a sibling.
 */

// header.before(message);
header.after(message);

/**
 * That is how we create and insert elements programmatically and now,
 * to finish, let's also delete elements.
 *
 * What we are going to do is, we are going to remove the 'cookie-message'
 * element, when we click on the "Got it!" button.
 *
 * So, let's select that button, and as we click it, remove the cookie
 * message.
 */

document
  .querySelector('.btn--close-cookie')
  .addEventListener('click', function () {
    // here we don't have to select the `message` element again because
    // we already have it stored in memory.
    message.remove();
  });

/**
 * This remove() method is actually very recent.
 *
 * Before this method existed, all we could do was to remove child
 * elements.
 *
 * So, we had to first select the parent element and then remove the child
 * element from there.
 * So, it would look like this:
 */

document
  .querySelector('.btn--close-cookie')
  .addEventListener('click', function () {
    // select the parent first, then remove the child element
    message.parentElement.removeChild(message);

    // NOTE: This will give an undefined error for now because the
    // above event listener is still working so, by the time code
    // reaches here, the "message" element must have been gone which
    // is why it says undefined. But, if you comment tha above code
    // and then try, this code will work just fine.
  });

/**
 * This was a bit cumbersome but, that is how we used to do it before
 * remove() method was introduced; and you might find it in some of the
 * old code bases.
 *
 * Also, many people don't know about the remove() method just yet.
 *
 * By the way, this way of moving up and down the DOM tree, like selecting
 * the parent element first, is called DOM traversing; and there is a
 * whole lesson about that a bit later in this section.
 *
 * This is how we select, create, insert, and delete elements.
 *
 * To make this 100% complete, just make sure that you review the insert
 * adjacent HTML method as well - that we used before in the Bankist
 * application.

/**
 * We will start working on the project very soon. But, for now, we need

 *
 * So here, we are going to learn about styles, and attributes, and

 *
 * Some of these tools we will use later in the project but, it is

 * we are going to learn now, but they are still important, so let's go.
 *
 * Let's keep working on our cookie message banner.
 *
 * We are going to start by talking about styles and we've already set
 * CSS styles before but, there are still some more things to learn.
 *
 * First, let's go back to the basics i.e. set a style on an element.
 */

// STYLES:

message.style.backgroundColor = '#37383d';

/**
 * Now the style nicely got applied to our element.
 *
 * Again, we didn't have to manually select the `message` element first
 * because we already had it stored in the `message` variable.
 *
 * Now, let's set the width of the `message` element.
 *
 * Remember that we have to write the CSS value exactl as we would do in
 * CSS i.e. we have to always include the unit.
 */

message.style.width = '120%';

/**
 * Remember that these styles are actually set as inline styles i.e.
 * styles directly in the DOM - in the style attribute of the HTML
 * element.
 *
 * You might think that we will be able to read styles using the `style`
 * property but, let's see what happens.
 */

// we get nothing
console.log(message.style.height);

/**
 * We get nothing.
 *
 * This is because using the `style` property like this only works for
 * inline styles that we set ourselves also using the `style` property.
 *
 * So, it will work for the background color because we set that style
 * using the `style` property as an inline style.
 */

console.log(message.style.backgroundColor); // rgb(55, 56, 61)

/**
 * Again, this worked because it is an inline style and a style that
 * we set using the `style` property i.e. we set it ourselves, manually.
 *
 * But, we cannot get a style that is hidden inside of a class or maybe
 * that doesn't even exist.
 *
 * For example, let's say that we wanted to get the color. The color is
 * defined in the stylesheet but, if we try to log it here, then it is
 * nowhere to be found.
 */

// we get nothing
console.log(message.style.color);

/**
 * We can still get the styles if we really want to, all we need to do is
 * to use the `getComputedStyle` function.
 *
 * It sounds a bit weird but, this is how it works:
 */

console.log(getComputedStyle(message));

/**
 * As you see in the console, we get a huge object which contains all of
 * the properties with their values.
 *
 * So, in practice, we simply take a certain property, like color, from
 * there.
 */

console.log(getComputedStyle(message).color); // rgb(187, 187, 187)

/**
 * These are the computed styles, which means that it is the real style
 * as it appears on the page - even if we do not declare it in our CSS.
 *
 * For example, the `height`. We didn't define it ourselves but, the
 * browser of course needed to calculate the height to display it and
 * so, we can then get access to that value.
 */

console.log(getComputedStyle(message).height); // 50px

/**
 * Let's say we now wanted to increase the height of the `message`
 * by 40px. To do that, we could simply get its height and then add
 * 40 to it like so:
 */

// note we used Number.parseFloat() because getComputedStyle() returns a string with "px" or unit.
message.style.height =
  Number.parseFloat(getComputedStyle(message).height, 10) + 30 + 'px';

/**
 * So, this getComputedStyle() can come in really handy.
 *
 * But now, finally, let's also work with CSS custom properties, which
 * we usually just call CSS variables.
 *
 * CSS custom properties are the ones in the `:root` declaration in the
 * CSS file.
 *
 * They are called custom properties but, they are more like variables.
 *
 * The idea of CSS variables is very similar to the idea of variables in
 * JavaScript.
 *
 * So this way, we can change the value in many places all over our CSS
 * files by simply changing the value in `:root`
 *
 * Now, if we can change the value from `:root` then we can also change
 * the value from JavaScript. So, let's see how.
 *
 * Before that, we first need to see where these properties are defined.
 * They are defined in the document root - in JavaScript that is
 * equivalent to the document i.e. `document` element.
 *
 * Let's say that we want to change the value for --color-primary
 *
 * We get that from the document root which is the document element in
 * JS, we access its `style` property and then call `setProperty()` on it.
 *
 * The `setProperty()` method takes two parameters. The first argument
 * is what we want to change, and the second argument takes in the value
 * of what we want it to be changed to.
 */

document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--color-primary', 'orangered');

/**
 * Now if you look at our UI, everywhere in our style where we used
 * the --primary-color, the color is now changed.
 *
 * So, with this, we can easily change the style of our page, simply by
 * setting one property.
 *
 * That is how we change the value of CSS custom properties.
 *
 * Also, we can use the `setProperty()` for all properties but, usually
 * it is just easier to do it the way we did above. But, we cannot do
 * that for custom properties so, in that case, we have to use
 * `setProperty()`.
 */

// resetting primary color to its original value
document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--color-primary', '#5ec576');

// ATTRIBUTES
/**
 * That's it for styles, let's talk a little bit about attributes now.
 *
 * In HTML, just to remember, every element has an attribute e.g.
 * `src`, `id`, `class` etc.
 *
 * So, in JavaScript, we can of course, access and change these different
 * attributes.
 *
 * Let's select the logo and access some of its default attributes.
 */

const logo = document.querySelector('.nav__logo');
console.log(logo.alt); // Bankist Logo
console.log(logo.src); // http://127.0.0.1:5500/Section%2013/img/logo.png

/**
 * As you see in the console, we get the alternative text and the source
 * of that image.
 *
 * The source might look a bit different than the one we have in the
 * HTML file but, more on that in a second.
 *
 * So, this works because on images, they are supposed to have the `alt`
 * and the `src` attributes on them and so if we specify them in HTML,
 * then JS will automatically create these properties on the object,
 * but if we add some other attribute that is not a standard then
 * JavaScript, will not automatically create a property on the object.
 *
 * So, let's go to the lessons-learned.html file and write a 'designer'
 * attribute to the logo image.
 *
 * If we now try to read `logo.designer`, it is not going to work.
 */

console.log(logo.designer); // undefined

/**
 * We get undefined - this is because `designer` is not a standard
 * property that is expected to be on images.
 *
 * Another one that works here and that's a bit different that you might
 * expect is `className`
 */

console.log(logo.className); // nav__logo

/**
 * So, className returns a string value of all the classes in the class
 * attribute of the element on which it is called upon.
 *
 * You might think it should be `class` but, it is `className` for
 * historical reasons.
 *
 * Now, the way we tried above for `designer` attribute does not work
 * that way but, of course, there is another way of reading its value
 * from the DOM. It is just a little bit more difficult but, it is not
 * a problem.
 *
 * To do that, we simple have to use `getAttribute()` method, like so:
 */

console.log(logo.getAttribute('designer')); // bhoami

/**
 * Just as we can read these values for these attributes, we can also
 * set them. For example:
 */

logo.alt = 'Beautiful minimalist logo';

/**
 * Now if you check the alt text of the logo in the chrome dev tools,
 * you will the updated alt text.
 *
 * There is also the opposite of getAttribute(), which is setAttribute().
 */

logo.setAttribute('company', 'Bankist');

/**
 * If we check the HTML in chrome dev tools, we will find the logo with
 * a new attribute called 'company' and its value set to 'Bankist'.
 */

/**
 * Remember that we got a different src in compare to the `src` attribute
 * on the logo element.
 */

// src in our HTML: img/logo.png
// we got: http://127.0.0.1:5500/Section%2013/img/logo.png
console.log(logo.src);

/**
 * Basically, the actual `src` is different than what we have in the HTML.
 *
 * So, the `src` that we got from `logo.src` is basically the absolute
 * URL, while what we have in the HTML is just a relative URL i.e.
 * relative to the folder in which the lessons-learned.html is located.
 *
 * If we want to get the `src` which is in the HTML file, then we also
 * have to use `getAttribute()`.
 */

console.log(logo.getAttribute('src')); // img/logo.png

/**
 * Sometimes, you really need the relative one so, make sure you use
 * `getAttribute()` at that point.
 *
 * The same is true for the `href` attributes on anchor tags.
 */

const link = document.querySelector('.nav__link--btn');

console.log(link.href); // http://127.0.0.1:5500/Section%2013/lessons-learned.html#
console.log(link.getAttribute('href')); // #

/**
 * Here, you once again see that you get the absolute URL when you use
 * `link.href` and you get the relative URL when you use `getAttribute()`.
 */

// DATA ATTRIBUTES
/**
 * Finally, there are also special types of attributes, called data
 * attributes.
 *
 * Data attributes are special kind of attributes that start with the
 * word data.
 *
 * Let's add one to our logo in the lessons-learned.html file.
 *
 * The data attribute has to start with the word 'data' and then dash,
 * and then what ever we want.
 *
 * What's special about this is that now this attribute is at logo.dataset
 */

// Here we use camelCase for version number while, we use kebab-case in
// HTML for this attribute.
// So just like property names, we have to convert this into camel case
// when working in JS - keep that in mind.
console.log(logo.dataset.versionNumber); // 3.0

/**
 * So for these special attributes, they are always stored in the dataset
 * object.
 *
 * We use data attributes quite a lot when we work with the UI and
 * especially when we need to store data in user interface i.e. in the
 * HTML code.
 *
 * We will see how useful that can be throughout the rest of this project
 * and of the course.
 */

// CLASSES
/**
 * Finally, to finish, let's talk about classes - even though, at this point, we already know
 * all there is to know about classes.
 */

logo.classList.add('c', 'd'); // you can add multiple classes
logo.classList.remove('c', 'd'); // you can remove multiple classes
logo.classList.toggle('c');
logo.classList.contains('c');

/**
 * Just as we can read a class using the `className` property, we can use it to set a class.
 */

// reading className
console.log(logo.className); // nav__logo c

// setting class using className - DO NOT USE THIS becuase it will override existing classes
// this is just for demonstration purposes only.
logo.className = 'bhoami';

// re-setting original class
logo.className = 'nav__logo';

/**
 * Now if you check HTML in chrome dev tools, the classes for logo must be udpated.
 *
 * However don't use className to set classes because it will override the existing classes
 * and also, it allows us to only put one class on any element.
 *
 * The add(), remove(), toggle(), and contains() methods allow us to add and remove classes
 * based on their names, without interfering with the classes that are already there.
 *
 * Just keep in mind that contains() is really called contains() and not includes() like it
 * is called in arrays.
 *
 * Hopefully, this lesson will serve as a nice reference for all the different ways of
 * working with classes, attributes, and styles in JS.
 *
 * In the next lesson, we will finally start working with our project.

 * button.
 *
 * Essentially, we need those coordinates so we can tell JS, where to
 * scroll to.
 *
 * So, in order to do that, we will use a method called `window.scrollTo()`
 * `window.scrollTo()` is a global function that is available on the
 * window object, and its first argument is the left position and the
 * second argument is the top position.
 *
 * So, in our case, we need the left and top position of the section1,
 * and we can get that from `section1.getBoundingClientRect()`.

/**
 * Now if we click the button, it works. We are at the top of section1.
 *
 * However, if we scroll some and then click the button, it doesn't scroll
 * as we expected it to.
 *
 * That's because, `s1coords.top` is always relative to the viewport, not
 * to the document. So, not to the top of the page.
 *
 * Basically, `s1coords.top` is relative to top edge of the view port,
 * not to the top of HTML doc.
 *
 * So, it works when we are at the very top of the HTML doc. That's
 * because the y-position in DOMRect of the section1 is the same as the
 * top in its DOMRect - which is basically the distance between the
 * top of the section1 and top of the viewport/HTML doc.
 *
 * But, if we scroll, then the distance between the top of section1 and
 * the top of viewport is a lot less. So, it only scrolls that much less
 * of a distance. While, in fact, we want it to scroll all the way to
 * the top of section1.
 *
 * This might all be a bit confusing so, you might have to play around
 * with it on your own to really get the hang of it. Otherwise, it is
 * going to be hard to make sense of it.
 *
 * But, the solution to this problem is to simply add the current scroll
 * position to the top value of the RectDOM.
 *
 * With that, we will then determine the position of the section1, not

  `/***************** TYPES OF EVENTS AND EVENT HANDLERS *****************/`
);

/**
 * In this lessons and the next ones, we are going to talk a little bit
 * more about events.
 *
 * We have already worked with events ebfore, but now, let's add some
 * more important concepts and also make things a bit more clear.
 *
 * An event is basically a signal that is generated by a certain DOM
 * node and a signal means that something has happened, for example,
 * a click somewhere or the mouse moving, or the user triggering the
 * full screen mode and really anything of importance, that happens
 * on our webpage, generate an event.
 *
 * And as we already know, we can then listen for these events in our
 * code using EventListeners so that we can handle them if we'd like.
 *
 * But, no matter if we handle a certain event or not, for example, a
 * click, that event will always happen when a user clicks. So, it does
 * not matter if we are actually listening for it or not; and that's
 * going to be important to understand in the next lesson.
 *
 * We already worked with a couple of different events earlier in the
 * course, but now let's take a look at another type of event, which
 * is the mouseenter event, but let's start by selecting an element
 * and let's use the h1 element this time.
 */

let h1 = document.querySelector('h1');

/**
 * We already know about addEventListener() but, in this lesson, we
 * are going to take a look at two more ways of listening for events.
 *
 * The `mouseenter` event here is a bit like the hover event in CSS.
 *
 * It fires whenever a mouse enters a certain element - just as the name
 * suggests.
 */

/* 
h1.addEventListener('mouseenter', function (e) {
  console.log(`addEventListener: Great! You are reading the heading! :D`);
});
 */

/**
 * Let's try it out now, and indeed, as we hover over the heading, we
 * get the string logged onto the console.
 *
 * Let's now take a look at the list of different events on MDN.
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events
 *
 * Here you will see that there are all these different kinds of events
 * that we can eventually learn how to respond to.
 *
 * But, usually the most important ones are the ones related to mouse
 * and keyboard ones.
 *
 * But for example, there are also some for the clipboard, for full
 * screen, for resizing the page, and for when we scroll the page, and so
 * on and so forth.
 *
 * Anyway, let's now see another way of attaching an event listener to
 * an element, and that is by using the so-called `on-event` property
 * directly on the element.
 *
 * For example, when we want to listen for `mouseenter`, there is a
 * property called `onmouseenter`, and then we can simply set that
 * property to a function that defines what to do when the said event
 * occurs.
 */

/* 
h1.onmouseenter = function (e) {
  console.log(`onmouseenter: Great! You are reading the heading! :D`);
};
 */

/**
 * Now, if we check our console, it should work.
 *
 * And actually, for each of the events that we saw in the MDN docs,
 * there is one `on-event` property just like `onmouseenter`.
 *
 * For example, for `click` event, there is `onclick`.
 *
 * However, this way of listening to events is a bit old school. So, it
 * used to be done like this in the old days but now, we usually always
 * use `addEventListener()`.
 *
 * We are just learning about `on-event` in case you ever come across it
 * in some code bases.
 *
 * There are two reasons as to why the `addEventListener()` is better.
 *
 * The first one is that it allows us to add multiple event listeners to
 * the same event. So we could use the `addEventListener()` again on the
 * same element, with the same type of event but, change the callback
 * function.
 *
 * But, if we did the same with the `on-event` property, then the second
 * function will simply override the first one.
 *
 * That's one advantage of the addEventListener.
 *
 * The second one, even more important, we can actually remove an event
 * handler in case we don't need it anymore.
 *
 * This is something that we haven't done before but, it is actually
 * very simple and very useful from time to time.
 *
 * To do that, first we need to export the callback function into a named
 * function.
 *
 * So, we cannot just write, for example, the same function and expect
 * it to work - that is not going to work.
 *
 * After we listened for an event and then handled that event in the
 * function, we can then remove that event listener by using
 * `removeEventListener()`.
 */

const logH1 = function (e) {
  console.log(`addEventListener: Great! You are reading the heading! :D`);

  // h1.removeEventListener('mouseenter', logH1);
};

h1.addEventListener('mouseenter', logH1);

/**
 * This is why we had to export that function, so that we could target
 * it while removing the event listener as well.
 *
 * So, now if we hover over the h1 element, we will get the log once
 * and then after that, we will get nothing. So, it will work exactly
 * once.
 *
 * That's because, in the same event handler function, we also then
 * removed the event listener.
 *
 * So, this makes it that we can only listen for the event once.
 *
 * So, this is a nice pattern whenever you only want to listen to any
 * event just once.
 *
 * But, of course, the removeEventListener() doesn't have to be inside
 * the callback function.
 *
 * You can remove the event listener at any place in our code.
 *
 * Example, we could remove it after a certain time has passed.
 */

// removing the event listener after 3 seconds have passed
setTimeout(() => h1.removeEventListener('mouseenter', logH1), 3000);

/**
 * So, this is another pattern of removing the event listener but of
 * course there are going to be other situations where this is helpful.
 *
 * Finally, there is also a third way of handling events, which is by
 * using an HTML attribute.
 *
 * This one should not be used but, just for the sake of curiosity, we
 * are going to take a look at it.
 *
 * So, head over to the lessons-learned.html for that.
 *
 * Those are the different ways of handling events and also how to
 * remove event listeners in case we don't need them anymore.
 *
 * Next up, you will learn the most important property of events, which
 * is bubbling. So, let's move on to it. (Theory Lesson)

/**

// navLinks.addEventListener('click', function (e) {

/**
 * Now even its parent elements' background colors are changing.
 *
 * So, based on what we learned in the last lesson, why do you think
 * that is happening?
 *
 * Well, just as we learned before, the event actually happens at the
 * document root and from there it then travels down to the target
 * element.
 *
 * The target in this case is the "Features" link.
 *
 * Then, from there, it bubbles up; and bubbling up means that basically,
 * it is as if the event had also happened in all of the parent elements.
 *
 * That is the reason why the particular event on the navLink is now
 * also being handled by the event listener on navLinks and nav.
 *
 * So, it is as if the click event on the "Features" link had also
 * happened on the navLinks and nav element.
 *
 * So, all three events are now handling the same event which happened
 * on the "Features" link.
 *
 * Now, what do you think happens when we click on the navLinks i.e.
 * outside of navLink?
 *
 * The "features" link itself remains unchanged but, the background color
 * of navLinks and nav changes.
 *
 * So, from navLinks, the event only bubbles up to its parent elements.
 *
 * Great!
 *
 * Let's now dig a little bit deeper and talk about the event targets.
 * Let's add a console.log() to each of these events.
 */

// navLink.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
//   this.style.backgroundColor = randomColor();

//   // e.target is essentially where the event originated i.e. where it first happened.
//   // it is not the element on which the event handler was attached. It
//   // is where the event first happened.
//   console.log('LINK', e.target);
// });

// navLinks.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
//   this.style.backgroundColor = randomColor();

/**
 * Now watch what happens when we click on the "Features" link.
 *
 * Again, all the three elements got a random background color, and as
 * you see, the `e.target` is always the same on each one.
 *
 * That target is of course, the element where the click first happened.
 *
 * And it appears in all three handlers because all of them are
 * essentially handling the exact same event.
 *
 * So, the `e` i.e. the event argument that each of these event listeners
 * receive is the exact same event. Again, this is because of event
 * bubbling.
 *
 * So, the event originates from the "Features" link but then, it bubbles
 * up to its parent element, which is navLinks, and from there to its
 * next parent element, and from there, it will travel even further up
 * in the DOM tree.
 *
 * So, we can handle that event in all of the parent elements and that
 * is exactly what we did here.
 *
 * Now besides `e.target`, there is also `e.currentTarget`; and the

 * Now if you check, the current target is not the same in each element.
 * It represents the element on which the handler is attached.
 *

 *
 * This is because the `this` keyword is also pointing to the element

 * event handler.
 */

/**

// });

/**
 * So, if we try to the click on the "Features" link now, let's see
 * what happens.
 *
 * Now the two parent elements did not change their background colors,
 * which means that the event never arrived at those elements.
 *
 * That's why they weren't handled there, and again, that is because
 * we stopped the propagation at the navLink. So, the propagation
 * phase then never happened for this event. Therefore, these events
 * never reached the navLinks and nav elements.
 *
 * In practice, it is usually not a good idea to stop propagation, but
 * we saw it here in case we really need it sometime.
 *
 * Stopping the event propagation like this can sometimes fix problems
 * in very complex appplications with many handlers for the same events,
 * but in general, it is not really a good idea to stop the propagation
 * of events.
 *
 * So, as we just saw, the three event handlers that we set up receive
 * events from the target elements and also from the bubbling phase.
 *
 * In other words, the event handler functions are listening for click
 * events that happen on the event itself or one of the parent elements;
 * and they are also listening for events bubbling up from their child
 * elements and that's the reason why the color changes in all of the
 * parent elements.
 *
 * So, the two phases that we just described are phase 2 and phase 3 from
 * the last lesson.
 *
 * But now, what about the capture phase - which was phase 1?
 *
 * As we learned, events are capturned when they come down from the
 * document root all way to the target, but our event handlers are not
 * picking up these events during the capture phase.
 *
 * As mentioned before, the `addEventListener()` is only listening for
 * events in the bubbling phase, but not in the capturing phase.
 *
 * That is the default behavior of the `addEventListener()` method,
 * and the reason for that is that the capturing phase is usually
 * irrelevant for us. It is just not that useful.
 *
 * On the other hand, the bubbling phase can be very useful for something
 * called event delegation. That's is something that we are going to do
 * in the next lesson.
 *
 * However, if we really do want to catch events during the capturing
 * phase, we can define a third parameter in the `addEventListener()`
 * function. The third parameter will take true or false. If we set it
 * to true, then the event handler will no longer listen to bubbling
 * events, but instead, to capturing events.
 *
 * In practice, that's going to look the same but as we take a look in
 * the console log, the nav will be first one appearing instead of
 * navLink, since we set the third parameter to true in nav.
 *
 * The reason for that is that the nav element is now actually
 * listening for events as it travels down from the DOM, while the
 * others are listening for the event, as it travels back up - that
 * happens later so, the nav is the first one to show up.
 */

navLink.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  this.style.backgroundColor = randomColor();
  console.log('LINK', e.target, e.currentTarget);
  console.log(e.currentTarget === this); // true

  // e.stopPropagation();
});

navLinks.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  this.style.backgroundColor = randomColor();
  console.log('CONTAINER', e.target, e.currentTarget);
  console.log(e.currentTarget === this); // true
});

// setting the third parameter to true
// this means that it will listen to capturing events and not to bubbling events

/**
 * They are all still working with the same event. They are simply
 * doing it in different phases of the event propagation.
 *
 * If that sounds confusing, please look at the last lesson again.
 *
 * NOTE: By default, the third parameter of the addEventListener()
 * is set to false.
 *
 * As mentioned before, capturing is rarely used these days. And the
 * only reason why both capturing and bubbling exist are for historical
 * reasons - from the time where different browsers implemented different
 * versions of JavaScript.
 *
 * Anyway, what really matters is that you understand why the three
 * elements, nav, navLinks, and navLink, get three different background
 * colors, even though the click only happend on the navLink element.

/**
 * That's it.
 *
 * That works beautifully.
 *
 * Now, as you see, this works just fine but, the problem is that it is
 * not really efficient.
 *
 * We are adding the exact same event handler callback function once to
 * each of the three links in the navigation.
 *
 * So, the exact same function is now attached to the three elements,
 * and that is kind of unnecessary.
 *
 * Of course, it would be fine for only three elements, but what if we
 * had 1000, or 10,000 elements?
 *
 * If we were to attach an event handler callback function to 10,000
 * elements like we did above then we would be effectively creating
 * 10,000 copies of the exact same function.
 *
 * So, that would certainly impact the performance. So, it is just not
 * a clean solution in that case and so, the better solution in that
 * case is without a doubt, to use event delegation.
 *
 * In event delegation, we use the fact that event bubble up; and we
 * do that by putting the event listener on a common parent of all the
 * elements that we are interested in.
 *
 * In our case, that is the navLinks element.
 *
 * So, we will put our event handler on the navLinks element and then
 * when a user clicks on one of the links, the event is generated, and
 * bubble up, just as we saw in the last lesson.
 *
 * Then, we can basically catch that event in the common parent element,
 * and handle it there. This is because we also know where the event
 * actually originate by using `event.target` property.
 *
 * So, that's what event delegation is and let's go ahead and implement
 * it.
 *
 * In event delegation, we basically need two steps:
 * 1) We add the event listener to a common parent element of all the
 * elements that we are interested in.
 * 2) In that event listener, determine what element originated the
 * event - so that we can then work with that element where the event
 * was actually created.
 */

// Event Delegation
// 1) Add event listener to common parent element
// 2) Determine what element originated the event

/* 
// adding the event listener to common parent element
navLinks.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  // figuring out where the event originated - this is stored in e.target
  console.log(e.target);
});
 */

/**
 * So, e.target becomes really, really useful now in this strategy,
 * because we can now use this information to see where exactly this
 * event happened.
 *
 * Now if we click on any link, we can then see where the even occured
 * in the log.
 *
 * Also, if we click inside the navLinks but outside navLink, we can
 * see where the click happened, which is navLinks and not any particular
 * navLink. This part is important to notice because we actually
 * only want to work with the click that happened on one of the links.
 * But the click that happened on navLinks is not at all relevant.
 */

// // adding the event listener to common parent element
// navLinks.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
//   // figuring out where the event originated - this is stored in e.target
//   console.log(e.target);
// });

/**
 * Now we need a matching strategy here in order to match only the
 * elements that we are actually interested in.
 *
 * In this case, the best way to do that is to simply check if the
 * `target` has `nav__link` class.
 *
 * NOTE: Matching strategy can be one of the hardest things to come up
 * with, when you use this technique.
 */

//   console.log(e.target);

//   if (e.target.classList.contains('nav__link')) {
//     console.log('link');
//   }
// });

/**
 * Now we only get "link" in the console if we click on one of the
 * navLink but, if we click outside of those, we get nothing.
 *
 * So now, we basically, successfully only selected the link elements
 * itslef.
 *
 * Now we can do exactly what we did before.
 */

navLinks.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log(e.target);

  if (e.target.classList.contains('nav__link')) {
    const id = e.target.getAttribute('href');
    console.log(id);
    document.querySelector(id).scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
  }
});

/**
 * So as you see, we still get the same sections as logged to the
 * consoel, and it scrolls to exactly where we want it to go.
 *
 * So, this works beautifully, and we successfully implemented event
 * delegation, which is a lot better, and a lot more efficient than
 * simply attaching the same event handler to multiple elements.
 *
 * Instead, we simply added one big event handler function to the parent
 * element of all the elements that we are interested in, and then we
 * simply determined where the click event came from.
 *
 * We also needed a matching strategy because we wanted to ignore clicks
 * that did not happen right on one of the nav links.
 *
 * And coming up with a matching strategy is probably the hardest part
 * of implementing event delegation.
 *
 * But there will be plenty of example in the rest of the course and
 * it will make a lot more sense to you at some point.
 *
 * Hopefully, you are now convinced that event delegation is a much
 * better strategy, even though it requires a little bit more work than
 * the first implementation that we did.
 *
 * In fact, there is actually an even more important use case of event
 * delegation, which is when we are working with elements that are not
 * yet on the page on runtime i.e. by the time the page loads.
 *
 * A great example of that are buttons that are dynamically added while
 * using the application.
 *
 * It is not possible to add event handlers onto elements that do not
 * exist, but we will still be able to handle events on elements that
 * don't exist at the beginning by using event delegation one more
 * time.
 *
 * And we will actually do it later in this section.

 *
 * But keep in mind that `children` only works for direct children.
 *
 * Finally, there is also first and last element child.
 *

 * 200 copies of the exact same callback function (of the event handler).
 *
 * That would simply slow down the page and it is not desirable.
 *
 * So, let's comment it out and use event delegation instead.
 *

   * the button.
   *
   * So, no matter if we click on the button itself or on the span

   * any clicks that happen in that area i.e. ignore clicks in the area
   * where the result is going to be null.
   *

   * In this case, when we have `null`, which is a falsy value will

 *
 * Now in this case, the parent of `nav__link` is `nav__item` and the
 * only thing that `nav__item` includes is always just one link.
 *
 * So you see that each of the link is actually inside of one nav__item.
 *
 * So now, we would have to move up manually, not just once, but twice.
 *
 * So, instead of doing that, we will again use the closest method.
 *
 * Again, instead of moving up manually, like one or two steps, we can
 * simply search for a parent which matches a certain query.
 *
 * That is a bit more robust because even if we would then at some point,
 * maybe change the structure of the HTML, then our JavaScript would
 * keep working.
 *
 * Here when we are trying to get all the sibling elements, we are
 * targetting the nav element. Even though nav is not the closest parent
 * i.e. there is another parent to all the nav__link elements, which is
 * nav__links but, it is no problem of choose an even higher up parent
 * like we are doing here.
 *
 * Now that we have a parent for all the sibling elements, we then
 * select all of its children elements that have the class of `nav__link`
 * so, these are going to be the siblings of the link where we are
 * hovering over.
 *
 * NOTE: These sibling links will also include the link that we are
 * hovering over.

 * Notice that the "open account" button is also a link. So, it also

 *
 * So our effect is working already but this is very repititive.
 * The code in `mouseover` and `mouseout` events are exactly the same
 * except for the values of opacity.
 *
 * So, let's refactor this code. Usually, refactoring works by creating
 * a new function. So, let's do that here.
 *
 * We will need some arguments here but more about that later.
 *
 * First, what we need to do is to compare the two pieces of code that
 * we are trying to refactor and then figure out what is the same and
 * what is different.
 *
 * In this case, it is pretty simple.
 *
 * All the changes that we need are the values of opacity.
 *
 * So, we can simple take the code from the event listener and create
 * an argument or a parameter for that opacity.
 *
 * And we can then pass that opacity into the function.
 *
 * Of course we still the `event` parameter, and then we need the
 * `opacity`.
 *
 * With this, we refactored our code nicely here.

 */

/**
 * But now, the problem is that we actually want to pass in values into

 * function the value of opacity.
 *
 * Also, we need a way of passing the `event`.
 *
 * You might think that we could simply pass in parameters like we
 * usually do i.e. using a set of parentheses, like so:
 */

// nav.addEventListener('mouseover', handleHover(e, 0.5));
// nav.addEventListener('mouseout', handleHover(e, 1));

/**
 * But this does not work.
 *
 * The first problem that occurs is that `e` is not defined but, the
 * main problem is that the `addEventListener()` expects a callback
 * function as the second parameter.
 *
 * When we use the parentheses, we are essentially invoking the function.
 * So, the value will then be the value returned from that function call;
 * in our case that is `undefined` because we aren't returning anything
 * from handleHover(). But, by doing that, the second parameter will no
 * longer be a function, it will become the value that is returning from
 * the function call.
 *
 * So, this is simply not going to work.
 *
 * So, we went over this many times, but it is always good to remember
 * that JavaScript indeeds expects a callback function as the second
 * parameter in the `addEventListener()` - and not just some other
 * regular value which would be the result of calling the function, like
 * we did above.
 *
 * The solution to this problem would be to still have a callback
 * function as the second parameter to the `addEventListener()`, like
 * a regular one, which JS will then call for us whenever the event
 * happens.
 *
 * Then, in that callback function, we could then actually call the
 * function with the event and opacity, like so:
 */

// nav.addEventListener('mouseover', function (e) {
//   handleHover(e, 0.5);
// });

// nav.addEventListener('mouseout', function (e) {
//   handleHover(e, 1);
// });

/**
 * This works because here we are basically calling the function
 * manually.
 *
 * So, the handleHover() will only execute as soon as JS executes the
 * callback function in the event handler.
 *
 * So, here we are back to working because here we are back to passing
 * in a real function.
 *
 * Now it should be working again, and indeed it does.
 *
 * So, that is the second version of our code working but, we can do
 * even better and remove the anonymous callback functions altogether.
 *
 * We can do that by using the bind() method that we already studied
 * before.
 *
 * Remember that the bind() method creates a copy of the function that
 * it is called on, and it will set the `this` keyword in the function
 * call to whatever value that we pass into bind().
 *
 * So, let's do that.
 */

handleHover = function (e) {
  console.log(this); // checking the `this` keyword
  console.log(e.currentTarget); // checking the current target
  if (e.target.classList.contains('nav__link')) {
    const link = e.target;
    const siblings = link.closest('.nav').querySelectorAll('.nav__link');
    const logo = link.closest('.nav').querySelector('img');
    siblings.forEach(el => {
      if (el !== link) {
        el.style.opacity = this;
      }
    });
    logo.style.opacity = this;
  }
};

// Passing "argument" into handler
nav.addEventListener('mouseover', handleHover.bind(0.5));
nav.addEventListener('mouseout', handleHover.bind(1));

/**
 * This is going to work because `handleHover.bind(0.5)` and
 * `handleHover.bind(1)` are going to be a function, because bind()
 * returns a new function.
 *
 * In this function that is returned by bind() the `this` keyword will
 * be set to 0.5 and 1 respectively.
 *
 * To check, we can log the `this` keyword in the handleHover() function.
 *
 * Now you see indeed, that it is 1 or 0.5
 *
 * Also, remember that usually the `this` keyword is equal to the
 * current target.
 *
 * So, let's check that as well.
 *
 * The currentTarget has remained unaltered.
 *
 * By default the `this` keyword is the same as the current target i.e.
 * the element on which the event listener is attached to, but when we
 * set the `this` keyword manyally, of course, it becomes whatever we
 * set it to.
 *
 * So now, just like before, instead of `opacity`, we can set the value
 * of opacity as `this` because that holds the value of `opacity`.
 *
 * So, essentially, we used the bind() method here to pass an argument
 * into a handler function.
 *
 * So, any handler function can only ever have one real argument and that
 * is the `event`.
 *
 * But, if we want to pass additional values into the handler function,
 * then we need to use the `this` keyword like we just did here.
 *
 * And if we wanted multiple values, then we could of course, pass in
 * an array or an object instead of passing just one value in the bind()
 * method.
 *
 * So, this is kind of a workaround into the fact that the handler
 * function can only take one argument.
 *
 * So, it is really nice effect and as mentioned before, it also taught
 * us how we can pass arguments, essentially, into handler functions.

 *
 * That's why in the beginning we start at 0 because now the visible part

 *
 * So, remember that to make the navigation sticky, we will add the
 * `sticky` class from the CSS file.
 *
 * But now the question is, when exactly should the navigation actually
 * become sticky?
 *
 * It should happen as soon as we reach the first section.
 *
 * We cannot hardcode that value because the scroll position value that

  `/************* A BETTER WAY: THE INTERSECTION OBSERVER API *************/`

/**
 * Let's now implement the same sticky navigation that we implemented
 * in the last lesson but this time, using the new intersection observer
 * API.
 *
 * What is the intersection observer API and why is it so helpful?
 *
 * This API allows our code to basically observe changes to the way
 * that a certain target element intersects another element, or the
 * way it intersects with the viewport.
 *
 * From this definition alone, you might be able to see that this will
 * be useful in implementing the sticky navigation.
 *
 * Let's start this lesson by learning how the intersection observer
 * API actually works, without the sticky navigation. This is because,
 * in the beginning, this can seem a bit intimidating and confusing.
 *
 * To use the intersection observer API, we need to start by creating a
 * new intersection observer. We do it like so:
 */

// new IntersectionObserver();

/**
 * Within `IntersectionObserver()` function, we will need to pass in
 * an object of options and and a callback function. But let's leave
 * that for a bit later.
 *
 * Let's first store the result of calling `IntersectionObserver()` into
 * a variable - let's call it `observer`.
 */

// let observer = new IntersectionObserver();

/**
 * Now we have to use this `observer` to basically observe a certain
 * target. To do that, we call a method called `observe()` on `observer`.
 *
 * We pass in the target element into `observe()` method. In our case,
 * the target element will be `section1`.
 */

// observer.observe(section1);

/**
 * This will make more sense when we start creating the options and the
 * callback so, let's start by options.
 *
 * The options objects, as its first property, needs `root`. This root
 * is the element that the target is intersecting.
 *
 * Again, `section1` is the target and the root element will be the
 * element that we want our target element to intersect.
 *
 * This will all make more sense when you see it in action.
 *
 * For the value of `root`, we could now select an element or as an
 * alternative, we can write `null`, and then we will be able to observe
 * our target element intersecting the entire viewport.
 *
 * Viewport meaning the entire rectangle area which shows the current
 * portion of the page.
 *
 * The second property is `threshold`. Threshold is basically the
 * percentage of intersection at which the observer callback will be
 * called. This might be confusing but, let's just set it to 10% which
 * is 0.1 and then when we have the obsCallback function working, we
 * will see what actually happens in practice.
 */

// let obsCallback = function (entries, observer) {};
// let obsOptions = {
//   root: null,
//   threshold: 0.1,
// };

// // we pass in the callback function and options object into IntersectionObserver()
// let observer = new IntersectionObserver(obsCallback, obsOptions);
// observer.observe(section1);

/**
 * The observer callback function will get called each time that the
 * observed element i.e. our target element is intersecting the root
 * element at the threshold that we defined.
 *
 * Take a note of this because it is actually a bit difficult to figure
 * it out from reading the documentation.
 *
 * In our current example, whenever the first section i.e. our target
 * is intersecting the viewport (viewport because that is the root) at
 * 10% (10% because that's the threshold), then the observer callback
 * function will be called and it doesn't matter if we are scrolling up
 * or down.
 *
 * This callback function will be called with two arguments viz entires
 * and the observer object itself. So, we pass in the entire observer
 * instance itself in the callback. So, let's specify them:
 */

// let obsCallback = function (entries, observer) {};
// let obsOptions = {
//   root: null,
//   threshold: 0.1,
// };

// // we pass in the callback function and options object into IntersectionObserver()
// let observer = new IntersectionObserver(obsCallback, obsOptions);
// observer.observe(section1);

/**
 * In this case, we are only interested in the entries but sometimes,
 * using the observer is also useful.
 *
 * We can also have multiple thresholds i.e. we can pass in an array
 * for the value of threshold, and we will do that in a minute.
 *
 * So, the `entries` that we pass into the observer callback is threshold
 * entires.
 *
 * In this case, we only have one element as threshold but, let's create
 * a more general function already which basically loops over the
 * entries so that we can take a look at all of them.
 */

// let obsCallback = function (entries, observer) {
//   entries.forEach(entry => {
//     console.log(entry);
//   });
// };

// let obsOptions = {
//   root: null,
//   threshold: 0.1,
// };

// // we pass in the callback function and options object into IntersectionObserver()
// let observer = new IntersectionObserver(obsCallback, obsOptions);
// observer.observe(section1);

/**
 * Now if we take a look at the console, we already get an intersection
 * observer entry.
 *
 * This is not really interesting yet, because this is just the first
 * one that we got and we can see that the ratio in the intersection is
 * at 0 but, let's see in a second what that actually means.
 *
 * So, as we scroll through the page and as soon as we hit our target,
 * we get our first real entry in the console which appeared because
 * our target element came into the viewport.
 *
 * Our target element is the whole section 1 and once it appears in
 * the viewport, you essentially see that it starts intersecting with the
 * viewport.
 *
 * So, our observer is observing that, and if you expand the intersection
 * observer entry, you will see the intersection ratio at the time
 * that the callback was called which is 0.1... and that's exactly the
 * 10% threshold that we defined in our options object.
 *
 * We also get the `isIntersecting` property, which in our case is true,
 * and that is because indeed, our target i.e. the whole section 1 is
 * now intersecting the viewport.
 *
 * And we are looking for the viewport because we set the `root` to
 * `null`.
 *
 * Now if we move below section 1 and scroll back up again, we see
 * another intersection entry. The intersection ratio in that one is
 * close to 10% but not 10 - it is below 10 and that is why the
 * `isIntersecting` property is `false`.
 *
 * You can see why this is more efficient. It is because we only get
 * to see this kind of event in the situation that we are actually
 * interested in. In this case, that is the threshold of 10%.
 *
 * As we keep scrolling, and go completely out of section1 view, we
 * get another intersection where `isIntersection` is false. That's
 * because we no longer have 10% visible.
 *
 * So, you can think of threshold as the percentage that we want to have
 * visible in our root.
 *
 * This is the very fundamentals of how the intersection observer API
 * works, and it is a bit confusing and it takes time to figure it all
 * out so probably, the best idea for a beginner is to pause this lesson
 * at this point and explore a little bit on your own.
 *
 * So, you can use different threshold values and maybe use different
 * targets or roots as well.
 *
 * So, it would be a good idea to experiment more with this.
 *
 * What we are going to do now is to specify an array to specify
 * different thresholds, and one of them is going to be zero, and the
 * other one 0.2 i.e. 20%
 *
 * So, 0% means that our callback will trigger each time that the target
 * element moves completely out of the view, and also as soon as it
 * enters the view.
 *
 * That's because the callback function will be called when the threshold
 * is passed when moving into the view and moving out of the view, and
 * this is really important to remember.
 *
 * On the other hand, if we passed 1 as a threshold value, then that
 * means that the callback will only be called when 100% of the target
 * element is actually visible in the viewport.
 *
 * In the case of section1 , that is impossible because section1 is
 * already bigger than the viewport.
 *
 * Let's now experiment with 0 as the threshold.
 *
 * We get intersection event right away, and the intersection ratio is
 * exactly at 0, but it is already intersection and so it is because
 * basically the threshold was already passed.
 *
 * Then we get another intersection for 0 when the section is completely
 * out of the viewport.

 *
 * So, let's implement it and thankfully, it is a bit wasy to do and

 * is `rootMargin`.
 *
 * This `rootMargin` (for example 90) is a box of 90 pixels that will be

 *

/************************* LAZY LOADING IMAGES *************************/

console.log(
  `/************************* LAZY LOADING IMAGES *************************/`
);

/**
 * One of the most important things when building any website is
 * performance; and images have by far the biggest impact on page
 * loading.
 *
 * So, it is very important that images are optimized on any page.
 *
 * For that, we an use a strategy called lazy loading images.
 *
 * So, in this lesson we will learn how to implement that strategy in
 * JavaScript.
 *
 * The main ingredient to the lazy loading strategy is that we have a
 * very low resolution image, which is really small and which is loaded,
 * right in the beginning.
 *
 * The dimensions of this small is only 200px x 120px and it is only 16kb
 * and the original one is almost half a megabyte.
 *
 * The original image then we reference in the <img> element as a
 * `data-src` attribute's value.
 *
 * `data-src` is a special `data` attribute that we learned about
 * earlier in this section.
 *
 * So, it is not a standard HTML attribute and any other attribute would
 * workbut instead, we used one of the special `data` attributes that
 * we can do ourselves.
 *
 * The idea is that as we scroll to one of the low resolution images,
 * whose value of the `src` tag is the low resolution image, we will then
 * replace its value with the path to the high-resolution image which is
 * specified in the `data-src` attribute.
 *
 * We then also remove the `lazy-img` css class which gives the image
 * a blurry effect.
 *
 * NOTE: The blurry effect is added to hide the fact that the image is
 * low-resolution as it will look very ugly and pixelated otherwise.
 *
 * So, let's implement it and it is not that hard, using the intersection
 * observer API.
 *
 * NOTE: That this one is really great for performance while the other
 * things that we did so far are more visual things. This one really
 * impacts how we website works and especially for the users who might
 * have slow internet connection or low data plan or a slow cell phone.
 *
 * Let's start by selecting our images, and let's call them imgTargets
 */

// selecting all the images which has the attribute of `data-src`
const imgTargets = document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]');

  console.log(entry);

  entry.target.src = entry.target.dataset.src;

  // Remove the blur effect
  /**
   * How do we remove the css class which gives our image a blurry
   * effect?
   *
   * It is a little bit tricky because the replacing the value of the
   * `src` attribute happens behind the scenes.
   *
   * So, JS finds the new image that it should load and displays on the
   * UI and it does that behind the scenes.
   *
   * Once it is finished loading that image, it will emit the load event.
   *
   * The load event is just like any other event so, we can just listen
   * for it and then do something on that image.
   *
   * This is important to do because if we remove the blur effect right
   * after the value of the `src` attribute was replaced, and if the
   * user has slow internet, the image will still be pixelated, as the
   * image would still be loading. Therefore, we only remove the blur
   * after the image has completely loaded and emits the `load` event.
   */

  // on the target image, adding event listener, and listening for the load event
  entry.target.addEventListener('load', function () {
    entry.target.classList.remove('lazy-img');

  /**

   * because it is not longer necessary as they already did our task of
   * loading.

/**
 * Hopefully, after this lesson, you are convinced that it is really
 * important to implement this kind of functionality into your websites.
 *
 * All you really need to do is to generate the placeholder images and
 * blur them a little bit and then implement the sort of "lazy-load"
 * logic, which really isn't too much work.
 *
 * Now, ideally, we don't want our users to notice that we are
 * lazy-loading the images. All of that should basically happen in the
 * background without our users noticing that.
 *
 * So, we should probably makes these images load a bit earlier.
 *
 * To do that, we can specify a `rootMargin` in observer options.
 *
 * `rootMargin` is something that we also did with sticky navigation
 * to make it load a bit before the threshold was actually reached,
 * and here we are doing the same thing.
 *
 * So, exactly 200px before any of the images is loaded, it should
 * already start loading.
 *
 * By doing that, we don't see any delay in loading when we browse the
 * page.
