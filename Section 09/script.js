/**
 * Let's start this section by learning about array destructuring.
 *
 * Destructuring is an ES6 feature and it is basically a way of unpacking
 * values from an array or an object into separate variables.
 *
 * In other words, destructuring is to break a complex data structure down
 * into a smaller data structure like a variable.
 *
 * For arrays, we use destructuring to retrieve elements from the array
 * and store them into variables in a very easy way.
 */

let arr = [2, 3, 4];

// traditional way of retrieving individual items from an array
let a = arr[0];
let b = arr[1];
let c = arr[2];

// array destructuring
let [x, y, z] = arr;

console.log(a, b, c); // 2, 3, 4
console.log(x, y, z); // 2, 3, 4

/**
 * Basically, we write the syntax [x, y, z] = arr; and then the first
 * element will become x, the second element will become y, and thir
 * element will become z.
 *
 * It looks like an array but, it is really noit. It is a destructuring
 * assignment. So, whenever JavaScript sees it on the left side of = sign,
 * it knows that it should do destructuring.
 *
 * When you do destructuring, just don't forget to actually also declare
 * the variables using const.
 *
 * Note that even though we did destructuring, which sounds kind of
 * destructive, the orginal array is not affected.
 */

console.log(arr); // [2, 3, 4]

/**
 * So, we are not destroying the array, we are just destructuring it i.e.
 * unpacking it.
 */

/**
 * When destructuring, we do not have to take all the elements out of the
 * array. When destructuring an array, it will simply follow the order of
 * the elements in the array.
 *
 * We can only take the first two like so:
 */

let [first, second] = restaurant.categories;
console.log(first, second); // Italian Pizzeria

/**
 * Now let's say that we only wanted to take the first category and the
 * third.
 *
 * To do that, we simply leave a "hole" in the destructuring operator.
 */

let [main, , secondary] = restaurant.categories;

/**
 * Now, the second element will be skipped and the one that would be
 * assigned to secondary is the third element in the array.
 */

console.log(main, secondary); // Italian Vegetarian

/**
 * With this, we don't have to create a variable for al the elements that
 * we might not even need.
 *
 * If we need the first and third element, we can just skip the one in the
 * middle.
 *
 * This is really powerful and we use destructuring to do a lot of cool
 * things.
 *
 * For example, let's say that the owner of the restaurant now decided to
 * switch the main and the secondary category.
 */

// this is how we would do it without destructuring:
// let temp = main;
// main = secondary;
// secondary = temp;

// console.log(main, secondary);

// this is how we would do it with destructuring
[secondary, , main] = restaurant.categories;
console.log(main, secondary);

/**
 * Another trick with destructuring is that we can immediately destruct
 * an array and then we can immediately destruct the result into different
 * variables.
 *
 * This basically allows us to return multiple values from a function.
 *
 * So, let's try that and write a function to order food.
 *
 * So, in our restaurant object, let's add a method and call it order.
 *
 * This order method will accept two parameters, the first parameter will
 * be an index for the starter menu and the second parameter will be an
 * index for the main menu
 */

/**
 * This is how we basically receive two return values from a function.
 *
 * We could have done it without destructuring and still return an array
 * from the function but, this is a very handy way of then immediately
 * creating two varaibles out of one function call.
 */

/**

 * further.
 *
 * What happens if we have a nested array?

 */

 * length of the array, and this can sometimes happen in real-world
 * applications, as you will see later.
 *
 * So, if we have an array that is shorter than we might think, then we
 * might try to unpack the array in positions that don't even exist.
 *
 */

// default values

/**
 * Let's pretend that we don't know the array
 */

let [p, q, r] = [8, 9];
console.log(p, q, r); // 8 9 undefined

/**
 * This is basically the same as trying to read an element at position 2
 * of the array [8, 9] but, it only has elements in position 0 and 1.

 * Moving on, let's now talk about the rest pattern and rest parameters.

 *
 * Remember that we use the spread operator to build new arrays or to

 *
 * Now, the rest pattern uses the exact same syntax, however, to collect
 * multiple elements and condense them into an array.
 *
 * So, that's really the opposite of spread.
 *
 * The spread operator is to unpack an array while the rest is to pack
 * elements into an array and since that sounds really confusing, let's
 * write some code and let's start by exploring the use case of building
 * arrays.
 */

// recap of spread operator
// Spread Operator because on the RHS of =
arr = [1, 2, ...[3, 4]];

/**
 * In the example above, we are still using the spread operator; and we

 *
 * However, we can also use it on the left hand side (LHS) of the

 * finally, we are just grabbing all of the remaining elements in the

 *

 * in the destructuring assignment.
 */

console.log(t); // 2
console.log(others); // [3, 4, 5]

/**
 * So, here we used the rest syntax because it is on the LHS of the

 */

/**
 * Let's see another example here. This example will show you that
 * we can use the three dots on both sides of the assignment operator.
 *
 * Let's say that we have an array which will be the entire menu; and we
 * know how to build that using the spread operator.
 */

// 1) Destructuring with Rest Pattern

const [pizza, , risotto, ...otherFood] = [
  ...restaurant.mainMenu,
  ...restaurant.starterMenu,
];

console.log(pizza, risotto, otherFood); // Pizza Risotto ['Focaccia', 'Bruschetta', 'Garlic Bread', 'Caprese Salad']

/**
 * So here, on the LHS, we are first using the spread operator to combine
 * the mainMenu and the starterMenu to create one big array which
 * contains the entire menu.
 *
 * Then, on the RHS, we are picking out pizza, skipping the second item,
 * then picking the risotto, and the collecting all of the remaining
 * items on the entire menu - putting them in an array and assigning
 * them to a variable called otherFood, using the rest syntax.
 *
 * NOTE: The rest syntax collects all the array after the last variable.
 * So, in our case, the last variable is risotto. It does not include any
 * skipped elements. So, it really just is the rest of the elements. For
 * that reason, the rest pattern always must be the last in the
 * destructuring assignment because, otherwise, how will JavaScript know
 * until when it should collect the rest of the array?
 *
 * If the rest pattern is not the last one in the destructuring
 * assignment, it will throw an error:
 */

// let exampleArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
// let [u, v, ...rest, w] = exampleArr; // SyntaxError: Rest element must be last element

/**
 * Also, for the same reason, there can only ever be one rest pattern in
 * any destructuring assignment.
 */

/**
 * Now let's use rest pattern in objects because, it also works indeed
 * in objects.
 *
 * The difference then of course, is that the remaining elements will
 * be collected into a new object and not into a new array.
 *
 * Let's work with with the opening hours and let's say that we want to
 * select only saturday and the rest should go into a new object, which
 * are the weekdays.
 */

const { sat, ...weekdays } = restaurant.openingHours;

console.log(weekdays); // {thu: {…}, fri: {…}}

/**
 * Now we know how the rest pattern works to collect elements in a
 * destructuring assignment.
 */

// 2) Functions with Rest Pattern

/**
 * Remember that for the spread operator, the second use case was to
 * pass multiple arguments into a function all at the same time.
 *
 * Now, as you can guess, the Rest Operator can basically do the
 * opposite.
 *
 * So, let's write an example function for that.
 *
 * In a real-world adding function, we want to take an arbitrary amount
 * of arguments and simply add all of them together.
 *
 * We will pass an arbitrary amount of parameters into an add function
 * but, we won't specify that number in the function parentheses so,
 * how will we be able achieve our goal?
 *
 * We will use the rest pattern, and in this case, it is actually called
 * rest parameters.
 *
 * So, in the function parentheses, we will use the rest pattern.
 * We will log that in the console, and once we do that, we will see that
 * we get an array of all the parameters passed into the function.
 *
 * Again, the rest syntax takes multiple values and packs them all into
 * one array. So, it does the opposite of the spread operator.
 *
 * With the spread operator we expand, and with the rest pattern we
 * compress. In case of function parameters, it is called rest parameters
 * or rest arguments.
 */

let add = function (...numbers) {
  console.log(numbers);
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
  }
  console.log(sum);
};

add(2, 3);
add(5, 3, 7, 2);
add(8, 2, 5, 4, 2, 1, 4);

/**
 * At this point, we have a working add function which can accept any
 * number of parameters.
 *
 * Now let's take it to the next level. Let's create yet another array
 * and call it x.
 */

x = [23, 5, 7];

/**
 * Mpw if we wanted to take these values (in the array x) and call
 * the add function, how would we do that?
 *
 * We simply use the spread operator. That's it.
 */

add(...x);

/**
 * This is exactly what we learned in the previous lesson.
 *
 * We are taking all the numbers of the array and spreading them in
 * paretheses when invoking the add function.
 *
 * So, this is a good example of showing hwo spread is the opposite of
 * rest because, after these numbers are being spread when invoking
 * the function, inside the function, they are being collected into the
 * numbers array by the rest parameter.
 *
 * You might be wondering why we are not simply writing an add function
 * which takes an array as an argumetn adn then we don't need to use
 * rest and spread operators.
 *
 * Well, it is way better to do it the way we did because then the
 * function can accept both an array (by using the spread operator) as
 * well as all the single values.
 *
 * Also, it feels a little bit more natural to simply pass as many
 * arguments as we want to add together into the function. So, without
 * having to deal with arrays if we don't want to.
 *
 * So, the rest parameters is something that you will see all the time
 * in modern JavaScript code basis.
 */

/**
 * Now to finish, let's use rest parameters in our restaurant example
 * to see some edge cases.
 *
 * So, let's add yet another method to our restaurant object and this
 * time it is going to be about ordering pizza.
 *
 * Pizzas need to have atleast one ingredient but, the other ingredients
 * are optional. So, rest parameters are perfect for this.

 *
 * Up until this point, we have used logical operators only to combine

 *
 * But the truth is that we can do a lot more with the AND and OR

 *
 * Let's start with the OR operator.
 */
///// OR OPERATOR /////
console.log(3 || 'Bhoami'); // 3

/**
 * This is something that we didn't do before, which is to use, basically
 * the non-boolean values as the operands for the logical operators.
 *
 * The result of the above operation is 3.
 *
 * This means that the result of the OR operator doesn't always have to
 * be a boolean.
 *
 * This is something that we didn't learn before.
 *
 * So, there are three properties of the logical operators that we didn't
 * learn them before.
 *
 * 1) They can use any data type
 * 2) They can return any data type
 * 3) They do something called short-circuiting a.k.a. short circuit evaluation
 *
 * In the above example, we used two non-boolean values and it returned
 * a non-boolean value as well.
 *
 * Now about the short-circuiting:
 *
 * In the case of OR operator, short circuiting means that if the first
 * value is a truthy value, it will immediately return that first value.
 *
 * That's exactly what we saw in the above example, where we got 3,
 * which is a truthy value.
 *
 * Again, if the first operand is truthy in the OR operator, then the
 * other operand will not even be evaluated.
 *
 * So, JavaScript will not even take a look at it.
 *
 * That's what we mean by short-circuiting.
 *
 * Let's see another example:
 */

/**
 * The result of the operation below is Bhoami. That is because the
 * first operand is an empty string which is a falsy value.
 *
 * So, the second operand will be evaluated which is Bhoami and it will
 * then be returned.
 *
 * Here we see again that the result of the OR operator doesn't have to
 * be boolean. It will simply be the truthy value.
 */
console.log('' || 'Bhoami'); // Bhoami

/**
 * Next up, we have true or 0.
 *
 * The first value is truthy, in fact, it is literally true.
 *
 * Therefore, that will simply be the result of the operator.
 */
console.log(true || 0); // true

/**
 * Here we have undefined or null.
 *
 * As we already know, undefined is a falsy value, and so we then go
 * to the second operand - so, there is no short-circuiting, and so
 * that is then the one that is going to be returned.
 *
 * So, we get null; and that happens even though null is a falsy value.
 */
console.log(undefined || null); // null

/**
 * Let's now generalize this to more operators.
 *
 * So, we can get the general rule of how this operator works, no matter
 * with how many values.
 */

console.log(undefined || 0 || '' || 'Hello' || 23 || null); // Hello

/**
 * The result of the above operation is "Hello".
 *
 * That's essentially because 'Hello' is the first truthy value in the
 * chain of OR operations.
 *
 * First it will go to 'undefined' which is falsy so, it will move on
 * to 0, which is again falsy, then to the empty string and finally to
 * "Hello", which is truthy. So, here the operation will short-circuit
 * the evaluation and "Hello" will be returned.
 *
 * If we think about it, it makes sense because in OR operation, the
 * result is true, if at least one operand is true.
 *
 * So, if the first operand is already true, then JavaScript doesn't
 * even have to look at the other values because the result of the
 * operation will already be true anyway.
 *
 * So, it will short-circuit and then simply return that first result.
 */

/**
 * Now let's see a more practical application of this.
 *
 * Let's say that there might be a property on the restaurant object with
 * the number of guests but, we don't know if it exists. However, we
 * want to basically define a variable based on this number of guests.

 * to 10. We will explore a great solution to this problem in the next
 * lesson.
 */

 *
 * So, in this case, what we're doing is to basically pretend that we
 * don't know if orderPizza() exists. So, we first check if it exists

 * with another string.

 * defined i.e. a variable that has a value which at the time is truthy,
 * then you can use the logical assignment operator.
