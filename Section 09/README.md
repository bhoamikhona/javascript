# Section 09: Data Structures, Modern Operators, and Strings

**About:** In this section, we will continue learning about basic JavaScript features and syntax, but this time with a focus on more modern JavaScript. We are going to deep dive into built-in data structes like objects, maps, and arrays. We will talk about modern ES6+ operators such as destructuring, and optional chaining and we will also take a look at how to work with strings and all this together will then give you a very solid and important foundation for the upcoming sections and projects.
