# Section 09: Data Structures, Modern Operators, and Strings

**About:** In this section, we will continue learning about basic JavaScript features and syntax, but this time with a focus on more modern JavaScript. We are going to deep dive into built-in data structes like objects, maps, and arrays. We will talk about modern ES6+ operators such as destructuring, and optional chaining and we will also take a look at how to work with strings and all this together will then give you a very solid and important foundation for the upcoming sections and projects.

## Lessons Learned

### Destructuring Arrays

- Destructuring is an ES6 feature and it is basically a way of unpacking values from an array or an object into separate variables.
- Nested Destructuring.
- Setting default values when destructuring an array.
- Go through the [script](./script.js) file for details

### Destructuing Objects

- When destructuring objects, the order of the elements do not matter, and we use curly braces to destructure objects.
- How to have different variable names when destructuring objects.
- Setting default values when destructuring objects.
  - Combination of the above two points.
- Mutating variables while destructuring objects.
- Nested Object Destructuring.
- Go through the [script](./script.js) file for details
