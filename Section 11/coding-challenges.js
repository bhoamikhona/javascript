 *
 * 1) Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs
 * actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's
 * array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it is
 * a bad practice to mutate function parameters).
 *
 * 2) Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data.
 *
 * 3) For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it is an adult
 * ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog
 * number 2 is still a puppy üê∂")
 * Run the function for both test datasets.
 *
 * Test Data:
 * Data 01: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
 * Data 02: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

   * This is the explanation for how we calculated avg2:
   *
   * We usually calculate average like so: (n1 + n2 + n3 + ... + nN)/N
   *
   * But, if we spread the denominator of N like so:
   * n1/N + n2/N + n3/N + ... + nN/N
   * we will get the same result.
   *
   * So, we can have our accumulator have the initial value of 0 so,
   * 0/N will be 0, and then in every iteration, we divide age by N.
   *
   * So, we will end up starting with 0/N + n1/N, then in the next
   * iteration  it will be (0 + n1)/N + n2/N
   *
   * In the next it will be (0 + n1 + n2)/N + n3/N
   * so on and so forth
   *
   * This will get us the same result.
   *
   * This solution allows us to see a use case of the array parameter in
   * the callback function, as we will use to calculate N, which is
   * array.length.
