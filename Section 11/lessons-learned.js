  `/************************* SIMPLE ARRAY METHODS *************************/`
);

/**
 * Let's begin this section with a couple of simple and very easy to
 * understand array methods, just to expand our array toolkit a little
 * bit more.
 *
 * Before we start learning about array methods, let's quickly understand
 * why arrays actually do have methods.
 *
 * Remember that methods are simply functions that we can call on objects.
 * Basically, they are functions attached to objects.
 *
 * So, if we have array methods, this means that array themselves are also
 * objects.
 *
 * These array methods are simply functions that are attached to all
 * arrays that we create in JavaScript.
 *
 * We will learn why all arrays have access to these methods in a later
 * section when we talk about prototypal inheritance.
 *
 * For now, just understand that arrays are objects, and that they get
 * access to special built-in methods that we can essentially see as
 * tools for arrays.
 *
 * So, as mentioned before, in this lesson, we are going to start by
 * learning some very simple tools that we can use on arrays.
 *
 * Let's start by defining a simple test array that we can work with, and
 * we will make it as simple as possible because that will help us
 * understand some of the things that we are going to do here.
 */

let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

/***** SLICE METHOD *****/
console.log(`/***** SLICE METHOD *****/`);
/**
 * The first method that we are going to talk about is the `slice()`
 * method. This slice() method is very similar to the slice() method
 * that is available on strings.
 *
 * With the slice() method, we can extract part of any array, but without
 * changing the original array.
 *
 * Essentially, we can take a slide of an array and that's why it is
 * called "slice".
 *
 * Just like with the slice() method related to strings, there is a begin
 * parameter which indicates the index at which we will start extracting.
 *
 * When we say begin parameter should equal to 2, the slice should
 * start at position 2 and take all the way to the end.
 *
 * NOTE: slice() will return a new array.
 */

console.log(arr.slice(2)); // ['c', 'd', 'e']

/**
 * We can also define the end parameter.
 *
 * But, just like in strings, the end parameter is not included in the
 * result.
 */

console.log(arr.slice(2, 4)); // ['c', 'd']

/**
 * The length of the resulting array will be end parameter - begin
 * parameter.
 *
 *  Next, just like in strings, we can define a negative parameter, and
 * it will then start to copy from the end of the array.
 */

console.log(arr.slice(-2)); // ['d', 'e']

/**
 * -2 will basically take the last two elements of the array.
 *
 * So, with this, it is pretty easy to simply get the last element of
 * any array.
 */

// last element of the array
console.log(arr.slice(-1)); // ['e']

/**
 * This is a very nice trick that is sometimes useful.
 *
 * We can also use a negative index as the end parameter.
 */

console.log(arr.slice(1, -2)); // ['b', 'c']

/**
 * We get ['b', 'c'] as the result above and that is because it starts
 * at position 1 and it extracts everything except the last two elements.
 * That's what the -2 means as the end parameter.
 *
 * If you find this confusing then just experiment a bit more with it.
 *
 * Finally, we can use the slice() method to simply create a shallow
 * copy of any array. To do that, we simply call the slice() method on
 * an array without passing in any arguments at all:
 */

console.log(arr.slice()); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

/**
 * If you remember, we already did something similar in one of the
 * previous sections, but using the spread operator, like so:
 */

console.log([...arr]); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

/**
 * The above trick with the spread operator gives us the exact same result
 * as using the slice() method to create a copy of the original array.
 *
 * So, now the question is if you should use the spread operator or the
 * slice() method, in order to create a shallow copy?
 *
 * That's entirely up to you. It is just a matter of personal preference.
 *
 * The only time you really need to use the slice() method is when you
 * want to chain multiple methods together i.e. calling array methods
 * one after the other.
 *
 * We will learn about method chaining later, in this section.
 *
 * That is the slice() method.
 */

/***** SPLICE METHOD *****/
console.log(`/***** SPLICE METHOD *****/`);

/**
 * Next up is a method with a very similar name which is called splice().
 *
 * A splice() method works in almost the same way as slice().
 *
 * But the fundamental difference is that it does actually change the
 * original array i.e. it mutates the original array.
 *
 * So, let's see it in action:
 */

console.log(arr.splice(2)); // ['c', 'd', 'e']

/**
 * The result of the above operation looks exactly the same as when we
 * used slice().
 *
 * But now, look at what happens to the original array:
 */

console.log(arr); // ['a', 'b']

/**
 * We see that all that remains in the original aray is the first two
 * elements.
 *
 * So now, the extracted elements are actually gone from the original
 * array i.e. splice() deleted them.
 *
 * So, what we can see is that splice() actually does mutate the original
 * array. It takes part of the array and returns it and then the original
 * array itself loses this part that was extracted.
 *
 * In practicem most of the time the value that the splice() method
 * returns, doesn't even interest us. All we are usually interested in is
 * to just delete one or more elements from an array using splice.
 *
 * One pretty common use case is to simply remove the last element of an
 * array.
 */

// removing the last element of the array using splice()
arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
arr.splice(-1);
console.log(arr); // ['e']

/**
 * The second parameter of `splice()` method is `deleteCount`. So, it
 * tells how many number of elements do you want to remove from an array
 * from the starting postion.
 *
 * Basically, the second argument is an integer that indicates the
 * number of elements in the array to remove starting from the index
 * of the start parameter.
 */

arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
arr.splice(1, 2);
console.log(arr); // ['a', 'd', 'e']

/**
 * So, the first parameter of the splice() method works the same as the
 * slice() method but, the second parameter is really the number of
 * elements that we want to delete.
 */

/***** REVERSE METHOD *****/
console.log(`/***** REVERSE METHOD *****/`);

/**
 * Next up, we are going to talk about reverse.
 */

arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

/**
 * Let's say that we are working with arr2 and the alphabets placed in it
 * are all in wrong otrder and we need to reverse it.
 *
 * That's exactly what we use reverse() for.
 */
let arr2 = ['j', 'i', 'h', 'g', 'j', 'f'];

console.log(arr2.reverse()); // ['f', 'j', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']

/**
 * Indeed, it now returns the reverse array.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * An important fact to note here is that the reverse() method actually
 * does mutate the original array. This is important to keep in mind.
 *
 * If we log our arr2, we will see that it is now reversed too:
 */

console.log(arr2); // ['f', 'j', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']

/**
 * You might be noticing that in each of the methods, we are mentioning
 * which ones mutate the original array and which ones don't.
 *
 * That's because it is a very important characteristic of each of these
 * methods. This is because in certain situations, we might not want
 * to mutate the original array, and then we cannot use of any of these
 * methods.
 */

/***** CONCAT METHOD *****/
console.log(`/***** CONCAT METHOD *****/`);

/**
 * Next up is the concat() method and this one is used to concatenate
 * two arrays.
 *
 * Let's create a variable called letters, and letters will be the result
 * of calling the concat() method on arrays.
 */

let letters = arr.concat(arr2);
console.log(letters); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'j', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']

/**
 * Now we have the 10 first letters of the alphabets in our `letters`
 * array.
 *
 * So, the first array will be the one on which the concat() method is
 * called.
 *
 * The second array is the one that we pass into the concat() method.
 *
 * In one of the previous sections, we achieved the same result in another
 * way, which looked like this:
 */

console.log([...arr, ...arr2]); // ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'j', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']

/**
 * This gives us the exact same result and it also does not mutate
 * any of the involved arrays.
 *
 * So just like concat(), which also does not mutate the original array.
 *
 * It is just the matter of personal preference if you prefer to use the
 * concat() method or the spread operator.
 */

/***** JOIN METHOD *****/
console.log(`/***** JOIN METHOD *****/`);

/**
 * Finally, there the join() method that we already talked about before,
 * but we will talk briefly about it here, just for the sake of
 * completetion.
 *
 * Let's join all the alphabets in our `letters` array by using the

 */

/**
 * So, as you already know, the result here is a string with the

 */

/**
 * Great! So, your array tool set is rapidly growing here. Remember that
 * you already know push(), shift(), pop(), unshift(), indexOf(), and
 * includes() from the intro section.
 *
 * Now, if you ever lose track of all of these different methods, and how
 * they work, you can always come back to these lessons or of course,
 * check the documentation on MDN.
 *
 * No developer knows all of these by heart because it is just too many
 * methods to keep track of and it is very hard to know everything by

 * to remind yourself of how these work.
 *
 * Let's move on to the next lesson now, where we will take array methods
 * to a whole new level.
 */

/***********************************************************************/
/************************** THE NEW AT METHOD **************************/

console.log(
  `/************************** THE NEW AT METHOD **************************/`
);

/**
 * There's a new, very simple array method in ES2022, which is the at()
 * method. So, let's take a look at it.
 *
 * Let's start by creating a dummy array:
 */

arr = [23, 11, 64];

/**
 * Now, if we wanted to take one of these value out of the array, let's

 */

console.log(arr[0]); // 23

/**

 */

console.log(arr.at(0)); // 23

/**
 * Basically, we can now replace the traditional bracket notation with the
 * more modern looking at() method, if we prefer to use array methods like
 * this.
 *
 * Maybe this doesn't look all too useful. What is the big deal here?
 * Actually, there is one particularity of the at() method which makes it
 * quite useful to use instead of the brackets notation.
 *
 * Let's now say that we wanted to get the last element of the array.
 *

 *
 * Using the slice() method, we get the copy of the original array and if
 * we pass in -1, we get the last element of the array.
 *
 * Just like we learned in the previous lesson.
 *
 * As a result, we get a copy of the array only with the last element in
 * it.
 */

console.log(arr.slice(-1)); // [64]

/**
 * But, since we only need the value, we can use the brackets notation
 * to pull that out of the array, like so:
 */

console.log(arr.slice(-1)[0]); // 64

/**
 * So, these are the two more traditional ways of solving the problem
 * of getting the last element.
 *
 * However, as you can probably guess, the new at() method makes this
 * process even easier.
 *
 * Now, all we have to do is write this:
 */

console.log(arr.at(-1)); // 64

/**
 * Essentially, we can pass in negative indexes in the at() method, just
 * like we did in the slice() method.
 *
 * Basically, the negative indexes start counting from the right side
 * of the i.e. the end of the array.
 *
 * If we pass in -2, we get the second to last element of the array:
 */

console.log(arr.at(-2)); // 11

/**
 * But, most of the time, the thing that we are most interested in is the

 *
 * Now the question is, should you use the at() method or should you use
 * the bracket notation?
 *
 * If you want to get the last element of an array, or basically start
 * counting from the end of an array, then you should probably start
 * using the at() method. Also, if you want to do something called
 * "Method Chaining", which we will talk about later in this section,
 * then the at() method is also perfect for that.
 *
 * On the other hand, if you just want to quickly get a value from an

 * using the brackets notation.

 * to print a message for each movement in this bank account.
 *
 * The positive values are deposits and the negative values are

 *
 * So, we can print something to the console that says whether the user
 * deposited or withdrew some money.
 *
 * We will first do that by using the for-of loop, just so we can compare
 * it with forEach() method.

  }
}

/**
 * Our for-of solution works perfectly but now, let's finally learn how
 * to use the forEach() method to achieve the exact same thing - buy
 * in an easier way.
 *
 * We call the forEach() method on the movements array and as an argument,
 * it requires a callback function.
 *
 * So, forEach() is technically a higher order function as we learned in
 * the last section, whcih requires a callback function in order to tell
 * it what to do.
 *
 * So, it is the forEach() method that will call the callback function,
 * we will not be calling it ourselves. That is, of course, important to
 * keep in mind.
 *
 * When exactly will the forEach() method actually call the callback
 * function?
 *
 * Well, what the forEach() method does is to loop over the array, and in
 * each iteration it will execute the callback function that we pass in.
 *
 * Also as the forEach() method calls the callback function in each
 * iteration it will pass in the current element of the array as an
 * argument.
 *
 * So, we can specify that in the callback function as a parameter, and
 * in our case, let's call it again 'movement'.
 *
 * So, each time the callback function is called (i.e. in each iteration)
 * it will receive the current element of the array as an argument.
 *
 * We can of course give any name to this argument as we want but, let's
 * just call it 'movement' because that what we called it in the for-of
 * loop.
 *
 * In the code body of this callback function, we can do exactly what we
 * did in the for-of loop.
 */

console.log(`---`);

movements.forEach(function (movement) {
  if (movement > 0) {
    console.log(`You deposited ${movement}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`You withdrew ${Math.abs(movement)}`);
  }
});

/**
 * Indeed, we get the same result as we got in with the for-of loop.
 *
 * That's essentially how the forEach() method works.
 *
 * So, basically behind the scenes, this happens:
 *
 * Iteration 0: function (200)
 * Iteration 1: function (450)
 * Iteration 2: function (-400)
 * ...
 *
 * so on and so forth, until it reaches the end of the array.
 *
 * This part of the forEach() method i.e. passing in the current element
 * of the array like above, is especially important to understand.
 *
 * Basically, this is exactly the concept that we went over in the last
 * section when we learned that we use a callback function to tell
 * another - higher order function exactly what it should do.
 *
 * So, in this case, we tell forEach() that in each iteration, it should
 * log one of the two strings on the console.
 *
 * So, we give the forEach() method instructions by giving it a callback
 * function which contains these instructions.
 *
 * It might be quite a hard concept to wrap your head around but, if you
 * just continue using it then eventualy it will start to make sense.
 *
 * Now if we compare the for-of and forEach(), you might notice that
 * forEach() method is a bit easier to write and easier to read.
 *
 * Maybe you don't agree with it but, that's okay because, it is always
 * good to develop your own style of programiming.
 *
 * But, using the forEach() method and especially understanding the logic
 * behind it with the callback function, is still really important for
 * all the other methods that we are going to learn later.
 *
 * Anyways, let's learn some more about forEach() method because we are
 * not done yet.
 */

/**
 * What if we needed access to a counter variable in the forEach() method,
 * just like we can access the current index of the array in the for-of
 * loop.

/**
 * Let's now do the same in the forEach() method.
 *
 * With forEach(), it is fortunately a lot easier to get access to the
 * current index.
 *
 * To understand how it works, we need to remember once more that it is
 * the forEach() method who calls the callback function in each iteration.
 *
 * And as it calls this callback function, it also passes in the current
 * element of th array but, actually that's not all it passes in. In fact,
 * forEach() passes in the current element, the index and the entire
 * array that we are looping.
 *
 * Therefore, we can specify them in the callback function's parameter
 * list.
 *
 * Of course, we can just use one like we have been doing thus far, or
 * we can use two or all three of them. And as always, the names of these
 * parameters don't matter but, what does matter is the order.
 *
 * The first parameter always needs to be the current elements, the
 * second parameter always needs to be the current index, and third
 * parameter always needs to be the entire array that we are looping
 * over.
 *
 * This is because that is the order in which the arguments i.e. the
 * actual values are passed into our callback function.

});

/**
 * I hope you can see that it is a lot easier to get the current index
 * in the forEach() method.
 *
 * Just notice that the order of the parameters is different in forEach()
 * and for-of loop.
 *
 * In forEach(), the first value is the current element and the second
 * one is the index.
 *
 * While when we use the entries() in the for-of loop, the first element
 * is the index and second element is current element.
 *
 * This is how we loop over arrays with the forEach() method.
 *
 * When should you use the forEach() method and when should you use the
 * for-of loop?
 *
 * Well, one fundamental difference between the two of them is that you
 * cannot break out of a forEach() loop.
 *
 * So, the `continue` and `break` statements do not work in a forEach()
 * loop at all.
 *
 * So instead, forEach() will always loop over the entire array and there
 * is nothing that you can do about it.
 *
 * So, if you really need to break out of a loop then you have to keep
 * using the for-of loop.
 *
 * Other than that, it really comes down to your personal preference.

 *
 * There is a point to what they are saying and there is some truth in it
 * but, some people prefer the fact how much smaller and cleaner it looks
 * with arrow functions.
 *
 * So, if you understand it well enough (i.e. how the arrow functions
 * work) then you will become familiar with it pretty quickly. Then there
 * is no problem writing code using arrow functions.
 *
 * The main thing that you need to keep in mind is that we are returing
 * the value that is written right after the "arrow". So, you need to
 * remember that writing the arrow is like writing the `return` keyword,
 * at least in one liners.
 *
 * If you understand that, then you are good to go.
 *
 * We will keep using the arrow functions in these kinds of situations

/**
 * It works just the same.
 *
 * In this case, we actually don't even need our third parameter which
 * is the array that we are iterating over. But, let's leave it there
 * for reference purposes.
 *
 * Also, it is a good idea to keep in mind why we actually get access
 * to the first two parameters.
 *
 * Once again, all we do here is to pass the callback function into the
 * map() method. But, we do not call the callback function ourselves.
 *
 * It is the map() method who will call the callback function for each
 * of the array elements in the movements array.
 *
 * Now, each time that the map() method calls the callback function, it
 * will simply pass in the current array element as well as the current
 * index and the whole array. Off those 3, in our case, we are only
 * using the first two, which are the current array element and the
 * current index.
 *
 * Hopefully by now, it is crystal clear of how it all works.
 *
 * Now, you could say that what we did here with the map() method is
 * essentially the same as what we did with the forEach() method. But,
 * in fact, there is a big, big difference between the two approaches.
 *
 * Before, we printed each line individually to the console, as we were
 * looping over the array i.e. in each of the iterations, we performed
 * some action that was then visible in the console and we call this
 * a side effect.
 *
 * So, the forEach() method creates side effects.
 *
 * But, with the map() method, all we did was to return each of the
 * strings from the callback. Basically, they got added into a new array
 * and finally, we logged that entire array to the console and the
 * elements one by one.
 *
 * So, in the map() method, we did not create a side effect in each
 * iteration. All we did was to build a brand new array.
 *
 * This idea of side-effects will become important again, as we talk
 * more about functional programming.
 *
 * This is how the map() method works. In the next lesson, we will see
 * a more practical application of it in the context of our Bankist
 * application.

/**
 * By adding all the movements (deposits and withdrawals), we end up
 * with the global balance of the account.
 *
 * The reduce() method also gets a callback function but, this one is a
 * little bit different than the other ones e.g. map() and forEach().
 *
 * In the callback functions of map() and filter() methods, the first
 * parameter is the current element, the second parameter is current
 * index, and the third parameter is the entire array upon which the
 * method is called.
 *
 * But, in the callback function of the reduce() method, the first
 * parameter is actually something called the accumulator.
 *
 * This accumulator is essentially like a snowball that keeps
 * accumulating the value that we ultimately want to return.
 *
 * So, in the case of adding all the elements or all the numbers of an
 * array together, that will be the sum.
 *
 * As always, the callback function will be called in each iteration
 * of looping over the array.
 *
 * So, reduce() also loops over the array and calls the callback in
 * each iteration, but now, what will we actually do in each of these
 * iterations?
 *
 * Since the accumulator is the value that we will keep adding to, what
 * we are going to do here is add the current value to the accumulator.
 *
 * This works because in each call of the callback function, the
 * accumulator will be the current sum of all the previous values.
 *
 * So, we will really keep adding to this accumulator in each iteration
 * of the loop.
 *
 * Finally, we also need to return `acc + cur` from the callback - this
 * is how the new accumulator can then be used in the next iteration of
 * the loop.
 *
 * Basically, in each loop iteration, we return the updated accumulator
 * plus the new current value. So, like this, we can then keep adding
 * to it in the next iteration.
 *
 * This callback function is the first argument of the reduce() method.
 * But, the reduce() method actually has another i.e. a second parameter,
 * and that is the initial value of the accumulator.
 *
 * So, the second parameter is going to be the initial value of the
 * accumulator in the first loop iteration.
 *
 * In our case, it is going to be 0.
 *
 * With that, we should be able to take a look at our balance now.

/**
 * We have one single number as a result. So, indeed everything was
 * boiled down to one number, which we can suppose is all of the values
 * in the `movements` arrays added together.
 *
 * When we look at the accumulator in each iteration, we see that in
 * iteration 0, the accumulator is 0, which is the value that we
 * specified as the initial value.
 *
 * Then in the second iteration, the accumulator is already at 200 and
 * that's because the initial accumulator value (0) plus the current
 * value in the second iteration (200) is 200.
 *
 * In the next iteration, the accumulator's value is 200 and it will be
 * added to the new current value which is 450 so 200 + 450 is 650.
 *
 * 650 will be the updated accumulator value in the next iteration.
 * This will go on until the entire array has been looped over.
 *
 * So here you can really see the snowball effect of all the values,
 * adding up to one final value. In the end, that value is essentially
 * the accumulator.
 *
 * So, this is really how the reduce() method works.

 * Let's do the same thing using the for-of loop.

 * sum.
 *
 * In our current example, the accumulator will be the one that will

 *
 * So, let's just start by writing the logic in a bigger way so we
 * can understand what's happening and then we will simplify it to make
 * it a one-liner function.
 *
 * So, in the function body, we want to return the current accumulator
 * value if it is bigger than current movement value, otherwise we want
 * to return the current movement value. This is because in the next

 *
 * Also, the initial value of the accumulator will be the first element
 * of the array. We could have set it to 0 but, if the first value of
 * the movements array was negative and we were looking for the minimum
 * value in the array then that wouldn't work. Also, imagine if all
 * the values of the array are negative and we wanted to find the biggest
 * value of them all, then 0 wouldn't give us the expected outcome.
 *
 * So, don't just set the initial value of the accumulator to 0 if you

/**
 * Remarks about Chaining:
 *
 * 1. We should not overuse chaning, we should try to optimize it because,
 * chaining a lot of methods one after another can cause real performance
 * issues if we have huge arrays.
 *
 * If we have a huge chain of methods, chained one after another, we
 * should try to compress all the functionality that they do into as
 * little methods as possible.
 *
 * For example, sometimes we create way more map() methods that we
 * actually need, where we could just do it all in one map() call.
 *
 * So, when you chain methods like this, keep looking for opportunities
 * of keeping up your code's performance.
 *
 * 2. It is a bad practice in Javascript to chain methods that mutate
 * the underlying original array. An example of that is the `splice()`
 * method.
 *
 * You should not chain a method like `splic()` or `reverse()`. You can
 * do it if you wanted to and for a small application like this, it is
 * not a big deal, however, in a large scale application, it is usually
 * always a good practice to avoid mutating arrays.

 * This time the result is not really what we are expecting.
 *
 * These numbers are not at all ordered in any way.
 *
 * The reason for this is that the sort() method does the sorting based
 * on strings. So, it might sound weird but, that is just how it works
 * by default.
 *
 * Basically, what it does is to convert everything to strings and then
 * it does the sorting itself.
 *
 * And if we look at the results as if they were strings, then the result
 * actually makes sense.
 *
 * The negative values always comes first. Then we have value that starts
 * with 1, then with 4, then with 6. After that are all the positive
 * values. The first positive value starts with 1, the second with 2, the
 * third with 3, fourth with 4, and last one with 7.
 *
 * So, they are alphabetically ordered as if they were strings.
 *
 * However, they are not strings and so we have to fix it.
 * In fact, we can fix it by passing in a compare callback function
 * into the sort() method.
 *
 * This callback function is called with two arguments. Let's simply
 * call those arguments `a` and `b`.
 *
 * These two parameters are essentially the current value and the next
 * value, if we imagine the sort() method looping over the array.
 *
 * However, in order to understand how the compare callback function
 * works, let's just think of a and b as simply being two consecutive
 * numbers in the array; and it doesn't matter which ones.
 *
 * Now, in our callback function, if we return a value that is less than
 * 0 then the value a will be sorted before value b.
 *
 * And if we return a value that is greater than 0, then b will be put
 * before a.
 *
 * So, let's use that in practice to sort the movements array in

/**
 * Let's now move on and see a more real use-case of the Array.from()
 * function.
 *
 * The Array.from() function was initially introduced into JavaScript
 * in order to create arrays from array like structures.
 *
 * Remember how we talked about so-called iterables before i.e. Strings,
 * Maps, or Sets - they are all iterables.
 *
 * Since they are iterables, they can be converted to real arrays using
 * Array.from()
 *
 * That's also the reason for the name of the function because we can
 * create arrays from other things.
 *
 * Aside from these obvious iterables that we just mentioned, like Maps
 * and Sets, another greate example of an array like structure is the
 * result of using `querySelectorAll()`.
 *
 * Maybe you remember that `querySelectorAll()` returns something called
 * a NodeList, which is something like an array, which contains all the
 * selected elements.
 *
 * But NodeList is not a real array so it doesn't have methods like
 * map(), for example.
 *
 * So, if we actually wanted to use a real array method like that on a
 * NodeList, we would first need to convert the NodeList to an array.
 *
 * For that, Array.from() is perfect.
 *
 * So, let's do something here now and let's say that we do not have
 * the movements for our application stored in an array i.e. let's
 * pretend that we only have our movements stored in the user interface,
 * we do not have them anywhere in our code but, we want to calculate
 * their sum.
 *
 * Therefore, we need to somehow get them first from the user interface
 * and then do the calculation based on that.
 *
 * So, let's create a variable called `movementsUI`, we set it equal to
 * `Array.from()`, and we want to pass in the elements that we want to
 * convert to an an array.
 *
 * If we look at our index.html file, we will see that all the movement
 * values have a class called `movements__value` and we want to target
 * all of them so, we will use `querySelectorAll()` and target the
 * elements with the classname of `movements__value`.
 */

let movementsUI = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.movements__value'));
console.log(movementsUI);

/**
 * Right now we are only getting the values are currently hard-coded
 * in our HTML file.
 *
 * If we want to get the ones from a particular account, we will need
 * to use some event handler. So, let's do that - let's simply perform
 * this action when we click on the balance label.
 *
 * Side-Note: You can add event listeners on any object, it doesn't have
 * to be a button.
 */

labelBalance.addEventListener('click', function () {
  movementsUI = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.movements__value'));
  console.log(movementsUI);
});

/**
 * Indeed, it worked. We now get the movements from a particular
 * account, that we are logged into.
 *
 * Now we can use the map() method to get the number from the movement
 * object.
 *
 * So, once we get the NodeList from `querySelectorAll()`, we can
 * use the map() method on it, and on each element, we can take its
 * text content, remove the euro sign by using the replace method and
 * get an array which has all the movement numbers in it.
 *
 * NOTE: The map() method works because we used Array.from() on the
 * result that we got from `querySelectorAll()`. If we hadn't used
 * Array.from(), then the map() method wouldn't have worked.
 */

labelBalance.addEventListener('click', function () {
  movementsUI = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.movements__value'));
  console.log(movementsUI.map(el => el.textContent.replace('€', '')));
});

/**
 * We can make this even better but, first, we need to convert the
 * elements in the resulting map() array into Number type.
 */

labelBalance.addEventListener('click', function () {
  movementsUI = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.movements__value'));
  console.log(movementsUI.map(el => Number(el.textContent.replace('€', ''))));
});

/**
 * Now we can use the second argument of the `Array.from()` function
 * which is the mapping callback.
 *
 * Basically, we can put entire map() callback in the second argument,
 * like so:
 */

labelBalance.addEventListener('click', function () {
  movementsUI = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.movements__value'), el =>
    Number(el.textContent.replace('€', ''))
  );

  console.log(movementsUI);
});

/**
 * Now when we click the labelBalance, we indeed get all the numbers
 * in the movements.
 *
 * So, let's recap:
 *
 * We used `Array.from()` to create an array from the result of
 * `querySelectorAll()` which is a NodeList.
 *
 * NodeList is not really an array but, it is an array like structure.
 *
 * An array like structure can easily be converted to an array using
 * `Array.from()`.
 *
 * Then as the second argument, we included a mapping function, which
 * then transforms the initial array to an array exactly as we want it.
 *
 * In the end, we get exactly the array of numbers that we intended.
 *
 * There is also another way of converting the resulting NodeList from
 * `querySelectorAll()` by using the spread operator and array brackets,
 * like so:
 */

labelBalance.addEventListener('click', function () {
  movementsUI = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.movements__value'), el =>
    Number(el.textContent.replace('€', ''))
  );

  console.log(movementsUI);

  let movementsUI2 = [...document.querySelectorAll('.movements__value')];
  console.log(movementsUI2);
});

/**
 * So, that also creates an array but then, we would have to do the
 * mapping separately. Due to that reason, Array.from() is prefered.
 *
 * Therefore Array.from() function was a great addition to JavaScript
 * in ES6.
 *
 * That is all that we had to learn in this lesson. Those were the last
 * couple of methods/functions that we had to learn about arrays.
 *
 * Indeed, we learned a lot of methods in this section.
 *
 * Keeping all of them in your mind to solve different tasks is a very
 * hard thing to do.
 *
 * So, to make sense of all of it, in the next lesson, we will learn how
 * to decide which array method to use in which situation to solve
 * different problems (It is a theoretical lesson).
