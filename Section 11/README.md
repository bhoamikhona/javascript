# Section 11: Working With Arrays

**About:** This section is all about arrays. In JavaScript, arrays are probably the most used data structure. We use arrays all the time, and therefore, JavaScript has countless modern array methods, which we can also imagine as array tools. In this section, we will learn all about these tools, how to use them, and more importantly - when to use them. We will do that while building our next beautiful project, so that you can immediately apply all these array tools to a real world situation. Let's get started.
