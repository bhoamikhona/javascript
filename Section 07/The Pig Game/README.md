# Section 07: Javascript in the Browser: DOM and Events Fundamentals

## The Pig Game

**About:** In this project, we are going to take everything we've learned up until this point, and build a game. This is a two-player game. The idea is that players take turns to roll a dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total but, losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

## Lessons Learned

- Flowchart - Flowcharts are representation of everything that can happen in the application.
- `getElementById()` - The `getElementById()` method of the document interface, returns an element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string. Since element IDs are required to be unique if specified, they're useful way to get access to a specific element quickly.
- Using Javascript to access the `src` attribute of an image element.
