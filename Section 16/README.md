# Section 16: Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, Async/Await, and AJAX

**About:** In this section, we will continue learning important JavaScript features. One topic that we haven't touched yet is asynchronous JavaScript. The goal of asynchronous JavaScript is basically to deal with long running tasks, that basically run in the background. The most common use case of asynchronous JavaScript is to fetch data from remote servers, in so-called AJAX calls. That's what we will do in this section while learning everything there is to learn about Promises, the fetch function, async/await, and error handling. So, let's get started with this yet another exciting section.
