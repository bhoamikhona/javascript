# Section 16: Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, Async/Await, and AJAX

**About:** Let's now continue learning important JavaScript features. One topic that we haven't touched yet is asynchronous JavaScript. The goal of asynchronous JavaScript is basically to deal with long-running tasks, that basically run in the background. The most common use case of asynchronous JavaScript is to fetch data from remote servers, in so-called AJAX calls. That's what we will do in this section, while learning everything there is to learn about Promises, the fetch function, async/await, and error handling.

## Lessons Learned

### Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX, and APIs

- Let's start the section by understanding what asynchronous JavaScript actually is, and also learn about the most popular use cases of asynchronous JS, which is basically to make so-called <ins>AJAX calls</ins> to APIs.

#### Synchronous Code

- To understand what asynchronous JS code actually is, we first need to understand what synchronous (opposite of asynchronous) code is.
- Most of the code that we have been writing so far in the course has been synchronous code, and synchronous simply means that the code is executed line by line, in the exact order of execution that we defined in our code, like in this small example:

```javascript
const p = document.querySelector('.p');
p.textContent = 'My name is Bhoami!';
alert('Text set!');
p.style.color = 'red';
```

- As the first line of code is reached in the execution, it is simply executed in the execution thread.
- Don't worry about the execution thread. It is not important here. It is just to make a point of synchronous vs. asynchronous code, as you will see in a minute.
- All you need to know is that the execution thread is a part of the execution context, which does actually execute the code in the computer's processor.
- Then, the next line of code is executed, and then the one after that, all in sequence.
- So, each line of code always waits for the previous line of code to finish execution.
- This can create problems when one line of code takes a long time to run.
- For example, in the example above, we have the `alert()` statement on line 3, which creates the alert window.
- As we have experienced in the past, this alert window will block the code execution. So, nothing will happen on the page until we click that OK button. Only then, the code can continue executing.
- So, the `alert()` statement is a perfect example of a long running operation, which blocks execution of the code.
- This is hopefully, a nice illustration of the problem with synchronous code.
- Now, most of the time synchronous code is fine and makes perfect sense.
- But imagine that execution would have to wait for example, for a 5 second timer to finish. That would jsut be terrible. Because meanwhile, nothing on the page would work during these 5 seconds.
- So, that's where asynchronous code comes into play.

#### Asynchronous Code

```javascript
const p = document.querySelector('.p');
setTimeout(function () {
  p.textContent = 'My name is Bhoami!';
}, 5000);
p.style.color = 'red';
```

- This example contains the 5 second timer that we were just talking about.
- The first line of code is still synchronous here and we also move to the second line in a synchronous way.
- But in the second line, we encounter the `setTimeout()` function, which will basically start a timer in an asynchronous way.
- This means that the timer will essentially run in the background without preventing the main code from executing.
- We also register a callback function, which will not be executed now, but only after the timer has finished running.
- We have actually already done this many times in practice before.
- This callback function, that we just mentioned, is asynchronous JS.
- And it is asynchronous because it is only going to be executed after a task that is running in the background finishes execution.
- In this case, that is the timer.
- So, this callback that we just talked about gets registered, and then we immediately move on to the next line.
- So, the main code is not being blocked and execution does not wait for the asynchronous timer to finish its work.
- That's the big difference between synchronous and asynchronous code.
- So previously, we had to wait for the user to click on the alert window to continue execution and again, that's because `alert()` is blocking synchronous code, but nwo with this timer, the callback is actually asynchronous.
- So, it is only going to be executed after the timer has finished.
- Therefore, we say that it is non-blocking because in the mean time, the rest of the code can keep running normally.
- Now, when the timer finally finishes after 5 seconds, the callback function will finally be executed as well.
- So, you'll seee that this callback runs after all the code, even though in the code, it doesn't appear at the end.
- Basically, an action was deferred into the future here in order to make the code non-blocking.
- We already saw this behavior happening before when we first learned about timers, we just didn't know that this is called asynchronous and non-blocking code.
- In summary, asynchronous programming is all about coordinating the behavior of our program over a certain period of time. This is essential to understand.
- So, asynchronous literally means not occuring at the same time. That's what asychronous programming is all about.
- Now, as we saw in this example, we need a callback function to implement the asynchronous behavior.
- However, that does not mean that callback function automatically make the code asynchronous. That is just not the case.
- For example, the array `map()` method accepts a callback function as well, but that doesn't make the code asynchronous.
- Only certain functions such as `setTimeout()` work in an asynchronous way. We just have to know which ones do and which ones don't.
- But please understand the fact that callback functions alone, do not make code asynchronous, that's essential to keep in mind.
- Anyway, in order to really understand this, let's see another example.

```javascript
const img = document.querySelector('.dog');
img.src = 'dog.jpg';
img.addEventListener('load', function () {
  img.classList.add('fadeIn');
});
p.style.width = '300px';
```

- This example is about loading an image.
- The first two lines run in a synchronous way, one after the other.
- In the second line, we set the `src` attribute of the image that we selected in the first line - and this operation is actually asynchronous.
- Setting the `src` attribute of any image is essentially loading an image in the background while the rest of the code can keep running - and this makes sense.
- Imagine that it is a huge image, we wouldn't want our entire code to wait for the image to load.
- That's why setting the `src` attribute was implemented in JavaScript in an asynchronous way.
- Once the image has finished loading, a load event will automatically be emitted by JS. We can then listen for that event in order to act on it.
- Listening for the load event is exactly what we do in the next line of our example as well.
- In our example, we use the `addEventListener()` to register a callback function for the load event.
- So, just line in the previous example, we provide a callback function that will be executed once the image has been loaded and not right away, because again, all this code is non-blocking.
- So, instead of blocking, execution moves on right to the next line immediately.
- Then once the image is completely loaded, it is displayed on the webpage and the load event is emitted.
- Since we are listening for that event, our callback function is finally executed.
- So, once more, we deferred an action into the future making the code asynchronous and non-blocking.
- At this point, you should have a pretty good understanding of asynchronous code.
- There is just one more important thing that needs to be mentioned, which is the fact that event listeners alone do not make code asynchronous, just like callback function alone, also do not make the code asynchronous.
- For example, an event listener, listening for a click on a button is not doing any work in the background. It is simply waiting for a click to happen, but it is not doing anything.
- So, there is no asynchronous behavior involved at all.
- Now, what makes this cade example (above) asynchronous is simply the fact that the image is loading asynchronously in the background, but not the fact that we are listening for the load events to happen.
- So, what matters is the asynchronous behavior of a task, like running a timer or loading an image.
- There are more examples of asynchronous behavior in JavaScript like the Geolocation API that we used in the last section or AJAX calls.
- AJAX calls are probably the most important use case of asynchronous JS.
- So, let's see what AJAX is all about.

#### What are AJAX calls?

- AJAX stands for **A**synchronous **J**avaScript **A**nd **X**ML and basically it allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way.
- In practice, we make AJAX calls in our code in order to request some data form a web server dynamically i.e. without re-loading the page so that we can use that data in our application dynamically.
- For example, in the next lesson, we are going to make AJAX calls to request data about countries, and we can then use that data about countries to build a small application that shows us information about the country that we are currently in.
- The possibilities and use cases are endless, but more about that in a second.
- For now, let's quickly understand how AJAX works.
- Let's say that we have our JS application running in the browser - which is also called the client.
- We want the application to get some data from a web server. Let's say the data about countries that we were talking about earlier.
- So with AJAX, we can do a HTTP request to the server, which has this data and the server will then send back a response containing that data that we requested.
- This back and forth between client and server all happens asychronously in the background, just the way we learned before.
- There can even be different types of requests, like get requests to receive data or post request to send data to a server. There is a whole lecture about this, a little bit later to really show you how it all works in detail.
- When we are asking a server to send us some data, this server usually contains a web API.
- This API is the one that has the data that we are asking for.
- An API is something pretty important so, let's now see what an API and web APIs actually are.

#### What is an API?

- First of all API stands for Application Programming Interface.
- In general terms, and on the very high level abstraction, an API is basically a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software in order to basically allow applications to talk to each other and exchange information.
- That's true not only for web development and JavaScript, but also for programming in general.
- In JavaScript and web development, there are countless types of APIs, like the DOM API or the Geolocation API that we have been using.
- These are called APIs because they are self-contained piece of software that allow other pieces of software to interact with them.
- For example, our Mapty application that we built in the previous section.
- Also, we can always implement a small and simple API in a class where we make some methods available as public interface.
- Again, objects made from a class can be seen as self-contained, encapsulated pieces of software that other pieces of software can interact with - and that fits the definition of API.
- But now, let's talk about the important type of API that we are actually interested in when we use AJAX. Those APIs are what we like to call the Online APIs.
- An online API is essentially an application running on a web server, which receives requests for data, then retrieves this data from some database and then sends it back to the client.
- When building applications in practice, we simply call these online APIs, API; and many people will also call these APIs, Web APIs, or simply just API.
- Jonas came up with the term Online API because the term Web API is actually also used for other things.
- Of course, we can build our own Online APIs, but that requires backend development i.e. development with servers and databases. This is something really interesting that you can learn about, after this course.
- Anyway, for now, we are interested in using 3rd party APIs i.e. the APIs that other developers make available for us - most of the time for free.
- So, let's now imagine that you are building a traveling application, and you have a database with different destinations and tours that you're offering.
- So, on your own server, you could build your own API that can receive requests from your front-end applicaiton in JavaScript and send back the results. That would be your own API, hosted on your own server.
- But that alone would probably not be enough to build a complete application.
- So, you could also use some 3rd party APIs.
- There are really APIs for everything.
- In our example, the travel application, you could use an API to get weather data in your destinations, data about the destination countries themselves, data about flights, about currency conversions, and you could even use APIs to send email or text messages or embed Google maps into your applications.
- So, as you see, the possibilities are really endless with PIs, and we can even say that APIs is what the modern web as you know it possible in the first place.
- So, using APIs in JS is super popular and everyone does it all the time.
- Now, just to finish, let's quickly talk about API data formats.
- AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. So, X stands for XML which is a data format - which used to be widely used to transmit data on the web.
- However, these days, basically no API uses XML data anymore.
- The term AJAX is just an old name that got very popular back in the day so, it is still used today - even though we don't use XML anymore.
- So, instead, most APIs these days use the JSON data format.
- JSON is the most popular data format today because it is basically just a JavaScript object, but converted to a string.
- Therefore, it is very easy to send across the web and also to use in JavaScript once the data arrives.
- Now that we know what asynchronous JS is,a nd also what AJAX and APIs are, let's finally use all this in practice, and make our very first AJAX call in the next lesson.

### Our First AJAX Call: XMLHttpRequest

- Now that we know about AJAX and APIs, let's actually make our first API call.
- In this lesson, we are going to build a nice UI component which contains data about a certain country.
- This data about the country is going to come from a third party online API.
- Let's get started.
- In JavaScript, there are multiple ways of doing AJAX calls but, we are going to start with the most old school one - that's called the `XMLHttpRequest()` function.

```javascript
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

- That's the first step of using the `XMLHttpRequest()` way of doing AJAX calls.
- As mentioned before, this is the old school way of doing AJAX in JavaScript but, we are still learning about it for 2 reasons:
  - First, know that `XMLHttpRequest()` exists because you might need it in the future.
  - Second, to learn how AJAX calls used to be handled with events and callback functions. Only after that, we should move on to a more modern way of handling asynchronous JavaScript, which is going to be a feature called Promises.
- Anyway, next we need the URL to which we will make the AJAX call.

```javascript
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

// first parameter is to mention the kind of request we want to make
// second parameter is a string containing the URL to which the AJAX call should be made to
request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/india`);
```

- Now, we need to send this request.

```javascript
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

// first parameter is to mention the kind of request we want to make
// second parameter is a string containing the URL to which the AJAX call should be made to
request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/india`);
request.send();
```

- Now in order to get the result, we couldn't simply set a variable to `request.send()` i.e. we cannot simply do `const data = request.send()`.
- The reason why we cannot do this is because the result is simply not there yet.
- So, this AJAX call that we just sent is being done in the background while the rest of the code keeps running.
- So, this is the asynchronous, non-blocking behavior that we talked about in the last lesson.
- So, instead of setting `request.send()` to variable, what we need to do is to register a callback on the request object for the load event.

```javascript
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

// first parameter is to mention the kind of request we want to make
// second parameter is a string containing the URL to which the AJAX call should be made to
request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/india`);

/**
 * Here we send the request.
 *
 * That request then fetches the data in the background and then, once
 * that is done, it will emit the `load` event.
 */
request.send();

/**
 * Using the `addEventListener()` we are waiting for that `load` event
 * to emit so, as soon as the data arrives, its callback function will be
 * called.
 */
request.addEventListener('load', function () {
  /**
   * The `this` keyword inside the `addEventListener()` is the `request`.
   * So, we could also log `request` but, let's stick with `this`.
   *
   * The response is in the property `responseText` - Again, this property
   * is only set once the data has actually arrived.
   */
  console.log(this.responseText);
});
```

- Now if you look in the console, we will have our first data - and as you can see, it kind of looks like a bunch of data about India indeed.
- Now we just need to convert this result into an actualy JavaScript object because, what we have is JSON.
- Remember that JSON is basically just a big string of text.
- To convert it, we need to use `JSON.parse()` method.

```javascript
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

// first parameter is to mention the kind of request we want to make
// second parameter is a string containing the URL to which the AJAX call should be made to
request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/india`);

/**
 * Here we send the request.
 *
 * That request then fetches the data in the background and then, once
 * that is done, it will emit the `load` event.
 */
request.send();

/**
 * Using the `addEventListener()` we are waiting for that `load` event
 * to emit so, as soon as the data arrives, its callback function will be
 * called.
 */
request.addEventListener('load', function () {
  /**
   * The `this` keyword inside the `addEventListener()` is the `request`.
   * So, we could also log `request` but, let's stick with `this`.
   *
   * The response is in the property `responseText` - Again, this property
   * is only set once the data has actually arrived.
   */
  console.log(this.responseText);

  // converting JSON to JS object and storing it in a variable
  const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
  console.log(data);
});
```

- Now, we have an array of objects where the object has all the data about India.
- Since, it is an array, we can take out the object that we want from it.

```javascript
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

// first parameter is to mention the kind of request we want to make
// second parameter is a string containing the URL to which the AJAX call should be made to
request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/india`);

/**
 * Here we send the request.
 *
 * That request then fetches the data in the background and then, once
 * that is done, it will emit the `load` event.
 */
request.send();

/**
 * Using the `addEventListener()` we are waiting for that `load` event
 * to emit so, as soon as the data arrives, its callback function will be
 * called.
 */
request.addEventListener('load', function () {
  /**
   * The `this` keyword inside the `addEventListener()` is the `request`.
   * So, we could also log `request` but, let's stick with `this`.
   *
   * The response is in the property `responseText` - Again, this property
   * is only set once the data has actually arrived.
   */
  console.log(this.responseText);

  // converting JSON to JS object and storing it in a variable
  const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
  console.log(data);
});
```

- Now we can build the card component. To do that we can create a template literal with HTML code in it and add the data in it dynamically.
- Then append the html element into HTML document.

```javascript
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

// first parameter is to mention the kind of request we want to make
// second parameter is a string containing the URL to which the AJAX call should be made to
request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/india`);

/**
 * Here we send the request.
 *
 * That request then fetches the data in the background and then, once
 * that is done, it will emit the `load` event.
 */
request.send();

/**
 * Using the `addEventListener()` we are waiting for that `load` event
 * to emit so, as soon as the data arrives, its callback function will be
 * called.
 */
request.addEventListener('load', function () {
  /**
   * The `this` keyword inside the `addEventListener()` is the `request`.
   * So, we could also log `request` but, let's stick with `this`.
   *
   * The response is in the property `responseText` - Again, this property
   * is only set once the data has actually arrived.
   */
  console.log(this.responseText);

  // converting JSON to JS object and storing it in a variable
  const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
  console.log(data);

  const html = `
    <article class="country">
      <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.svg}" />
      <div class="country__data">
        <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
        <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
        <p class="country__row"><span>👫</span>${(
          +data.population / 1000000
        ).toFixed(1)} people</p>
        <p class="country__row"><span>🗣️</span>${data.languages.hin}</p>
        <p class="country__row"><span>💰</span>${data.currencies.INR.name}</p>
      </div>
    </article>
  `;

  countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
});
```

- And it works.
- Now, let's re-use the same code to create an element like the one we already have for multiple countries.
- To do that we can put what we have inside a function and then call that function for different countries.

```javascript
const getCountryData = function (country) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

  // first parameter is to mention the kind of request we want to make
  // second parameter is a string containing the URL to which the AJAX call should be made to
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);

  /**
   * Here we send the request.
   *
   * That request then fetches the data in the background and then, once
   * that is done, it will emit the `load` event.
   */
  request.send();

  /**
   * Using the `addEventListener()` we are waiting for that `load` event
   * to emit so, as soon as the data arrives, its callback function will be
   * called.
   */
  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    /**
     * The `this` keyword inside the `addEventListener()` is the `request`.
     * So, we could also log `request` but, let's stick with `this`.
     *
     * The response is in the property `responseText` - Again, this property
     * is only set once the data has actually arrived.
     */
    // console.log(this.responseText);

    // converting JSON to JS object and storing it in a variable
    const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
    console.log(data);

    const html = `
      <article class="country">
        <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.svg}" />
        <div class="country__data">
          <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
          <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
          <p class="country__row"><span>👫</span>${(
            +data.population / 1000000
          ).toFixed(1)} people</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>🗣️</span>${Object.values(
            data.languages
          ).join(', ')}</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>💰</span>${
            Object.values(data.currencies)[0].name
          }</p>
        </div>
      </article>
    `;

    countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
    countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
  });
};

getCountryData('india');
getCountryData('usa');
```

- By calling this functiont wice, we will basically have two AJAX calls happening at the same time.
- And if we re-load the page a couple of times, the country cards might appear in different order.
- The reason for that is basically that the data arrives at a slightly different time, each time that we are loading the page.
- So in fact, this really shows the non-blocking behaviour in action.
- Now, if we actually wanted these requests to be made in a specific, pre-defined order, then we would basically have to chain the requests.
- Which means to make the second request only after the first request has finished.
- That's what we are going to do in the next lesson so that we can learn about something that developers call <ins>callback hell</ins>.

### How the Web Works: Requests and Responses

- In this lesson, we are going to go over a very high-level overview of how the Web actually works behind the scenes in regards to requests and responses.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/c7a6b7e6-ad36-47d9-a7b9-360500e268be)
- Above is the diagram that we saw when we first talked about AJAX calls.
- To recap, whenever we try to access a web server, the browser, which is the client, sends a request to the server and the server will then send back a response and that response contains the data or the web page that we requested.
- This process works the exact same way no matter if we are accessing an entire web page or just some data from a web API.
- This whole process actually has a name, and it is called the <ins>request-response model</ins> or the <ins>client-server architecture</ins>.
- Anyway, let's now dive a bit deeper into this.

#### What happens when we access a web server

- Let's use the example of the URL that we accessed in the last lesson to get our country data.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/c4aadebc-19d1-44d8-9cee-51e8b66f45ce)
- Every URL gets an HTTP or HTTPS, which is for the protocol that will be used on this connection. We will talk about this a bit later, in this lesson.
- Then we have the domain name, which is [restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com/) in this case, and also, after a slash, we have the so-called "resource" that we want to access.
- In our case it is "v3.1/name/{name}"
- Now this domain name, restcountries.com is actually not the real address of the server that we are trying to access.
- It is really just a nice name that is easy for us to memorize.
- But what this means is that we need a way of converting the domain name to the real address of the server.
- That happens through a so-called <ins>DNS</ins> which stands for <ins>domain name server</ins>.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/5b8d8599-157e-4b96-98f5-f9ff137ac51f)
- DNS are a special kind of server. They are basically like the phone books of the Internet.
- The first step that happens when we access any web server is that the browser makes a request to a DNS and this special server will then simply match the web address of the URL to the server's real IP address.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/18655dae-8267-4f87-b100-3760b53969ac)
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/d52a6ebf-a02f-4c79-88fa-b3f831333421)
- All of this happens through your internet service provider, but the complete details don't really matter here.
- What you need to retain from this first part is that the domain is not the real address and that a DNS will convert the domain to the real IP address.
- Then, after the real IP address has been sent back to the browser, we can finally call it.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/6584069d-3e9d-45a1-8c59-aadd8c03a217)
- This is what the real address looks like: "https://104.27.142.889:443"
- It still has the protocol, but then comes the IP address, and also the port that we access on the server.
- This port number is really just to identify a specific service that's running on a server.
- So, you can think of it like a sub-address.
- This port number has nothing to do with the "/v3.1/name/{name}" that we want to access.
- That resource will actually be sent over in the HTTP request, as we will see in a moment.
- That wraps up the first step.
- So, once we have the real IP address, a TCP socket connection is established between the browser and the server. So, they are now finally connected.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/db0c0dee-028f-4335-8bc6-692bafd3d439)
- This connection is typically kept alive for the entire time that it takes to transfer all files of the website or all data.
- What are TCP and IP?
- TCP is the transmission control protocol, and IP is the internet protocol. Together they are communication protocols that define exactly how data travels across the web.
- They are basically the internet's fundamental control system, because again, they are the ones who set the rules about how data moves on the internet.
- Don't worry if that sounds confusing. We will learn a bit more about TCP/IP a bit later in this lesson.
- Anyway, now it is time to finally make our request. The request that we make is an HTTP request where <ins>HTTP</ins> stands for <ins>**H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol</ins>.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/24a81fde-da9b-4152-b843-f997771f59e8)
- So, after TCP/IP, HTTP is another communication protocol.
- By the way, a communication protocol is simply a system of rules that allows two or more parties to communicate.
- In the case of HTTP, it is just a protocol that allows clients and web servers to communicate. That works by sending requests and response messages from client to server and back.
- A request message will look something like this:
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/a95a3e18-da1d-4e4c-bbf7-672ceb5c2cbd)
- The beginning message is the most important part, called the <ins>start line</ins>.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/b9a72c49-37b8-46a3-b69b-9a6fdc182dcf)
- And the one in our example contains the HTTP method that is used in the request, then the request target and the HTTP version.
- About the HTTP methods, there are many available but, the most important ones are:
  - GET - for simply requesting data
  - POST - for sending data
  - PUT and PATCH - to modify data
- So, you see, an HTTP request to a server is not only for getting data, but we can also send data.
- Now about the request target. This is where the server is told that we want to access the "rest/v2/alpha" (image example) resource.
- We had it in the URL before and now it is simply sent as the target in the HTTP request. So then the server can figure out what to do with it.
- Now, if the target was empty, so if it was just a slash, then we would be accessing the website's route, which is just "rescountries.eu" in the example image.
- Then the next part of the request are the request headers, which is just some information that we sent about the request itself.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/1b1555a2-6208-4570-86ef-47c16d33c9f0)
- There are tons of standard different headers, like what browser is used to make the request, at what time, the user's language, and many more.
- Finally, in the case we are sending data to the server - there will also be a request body, and that body will contain the data that we are sending, for example, coming from an HTML form.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/79a93712-6745-43d3-a9a9-cc9b61b5267a)
- So, that is the HTTP request, and hopefully all of that made sense.
- Now, of course, it is not the developers who manually write these HTTP requests, but, it is still helpful and valuable that you understand what an HTTP request and also a response looks like.
- There is also HTTPS.
- The main difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS is encrypted using TLS or SSL, which are yet some more protocols.
- Besides that, the logic behind HTTP requests and responses still apply to HTTPS.
- So, our request is formaed and now it hits the server, which will then be working on it until it has our data or web page ready to send back.
- Once it is ready, it will send it back using an HTTP response.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/cbfbba66-cd13-465e-abfa-4e167e161cf6)
- The HTTP response message actually looks quite similar to the request.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/bdddfce3-db1e-4d2f-8419-fceace46521d)
- Now, in this case, the start line has a status code and a message besides the version.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/50baa110-460a-4e58-b2bb-6fef51898fbb)
- These are used to let the client know whether the request has been successful or failed.
- For example, 200 means OK; and the status code that everyone knows is 404, which means page not found. So, this where that 404 comes from.
- Then the response headers are information about the response itself, just like before.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/64d6b3e7-d0a6-449c-ade2-9c2ddc201490)
- There are a ton avialble and we can also make up our own actually.
- Finally, the last part of the response is, again, the body - which is present in most reposnses.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/1b50251c-3277-499d-8e59-e6d62bb9dc36)
- This body usually contains the JSON data coming back from an API or the HTML of the web page that we requested or something like that.
- So, we talked in great detail about the most important parts here, which are the HTTP request and response.
- But in our imaginary example, we only just did one request to restcountries.eu and got one response back.
- That's how it is going to work when all we do is to access an API.
- However, if it is a webpage that we are accessing, then there will be many more requests and responses.
- ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/45118c27-5cd3-4d6e-85b7-165ab07750a7)
- That's because when we do the first request, all we get back is just the initial HTML file.
- That HTML file will then get scanned by the browser for all the assets that it needs in order to build the entire webpage like JS, CSS files, image files, or other assets.
- Then for each different file, there will be a new HTTP request made to the server.
- Basically, this entire back and forth between client and server happens for every single file that is included in the webpage.
- However, there can be multiple requests and responses happening at the same time, but the amount is still limited because otherwise, the connection would start to slow down.
- Anyway, when all the files have finally arrived, then the webpage can be rendered in the browser, according to the HTML, CSS, and JS specifications that you already know.
- Now, as a final piece of the puzzle, let's talk about TCP/IP and figure out how this request and response data is actually sent across the web.
- We mentioned before that TCP and IP are the communication protocols that define how data travels across the web.
- We won't go into a lot of detail here but, here is what we need to know:
  - First, the job of TCP is to break the requests and responses down into thousands of small chunks, called packets before they are sent.
  - ![image](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/5ab9701c-d14a-47f6-82be-6dace5d8accb)
  - Once these small packets arrive at their final destination, TCP will re-assemble all the packets into the original request or response.
  - This is necessary so that each packet can take a different route through the internet because this way the message arrives at the destination as quick as possible - which would not be possible if we sent the entire data simply as a big chunk.
  - That would be like trying to go through dense traffic with the biggest bus that you can imagine - probably not a good idea.
  - Second, the job of the IP protocol is to actually send and route these packets through the internet.
  - ![tcpip-gif](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/javascript/assets/50435319/1377ef0d-db00-4d0b-9acd-30f658da63dd)
  - So, it ensures that they arrive at the destination they should go, using the IP addresses on each packet.
  - That's it.
- That's a broad overview of what really happens behind the scenes of the web.
- Hopefully, you found this information useful and interesting.
- Anyway, now let's go back to our JavaScript AJAX calls.

### Welcome to Callback Hell

- In the last lesson, we did a simple AJAX call to fetch data from a country's API.
- We created a function for that and as we call the function multiple times, multiple AJAX calls were made at the same time. Basically, the call were running in parallel and we could not control which one finished first.
- However, in this lesson, let's create a sequence of AJAX calls so that the second one runs only after the first one has finished.
- Here's what we are going to do:
  - When we get a country's data, it has a property called `border` which holds an array with of strings. These strings are essentially codes that represent a country that are neighbours of the original country.
  - So, what we will do now is after the first AJAX call is completed, we will get the `borders` of the original country and then based on it, we will also render the neighbouring country on our UI.
  - So, in this case, the second AJAX call really depends on the first one, because the data about neighbouring countries is of course a result of the first call.
  - Without the first call, we wouldn't even know which data to fetch in the second call.
  - So, what we need to implement is a sequence of AJAX call.

```javascript
const getCountryData = function (country) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);
  request.send();

  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
    console.log(data);

    const html = `
      <article class="country">
        <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.svg}" />
        <div class="country__data">
          <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
          <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
          <p class="country__row"><span>👫</span>${(
            +data.population / 1000000
          ).toFixed(1)} people</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>🗣️</span>${Object.values(
            data.languages
          ).join(', ')}</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>💰</span>${
            Object.values(data.currencies)[0].name
          }</p>
        </div>
      </article>
    `;

    countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
    countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
  });
};

getCountryData('india');
```

- Here we have the code from the last lesson.
- First, let's change the name of the function to `getCountryAndNeighbour()`.

```javascript
const getCountryAndNeighbour = function (country) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);
  request.send();

  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
    console.log(data);

    const html = `
      <article class="country">
        <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.svg}" />
        <div class="country__data">
          <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
          <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
          <p class="country__row"><span>👫</span>${(
            +data.population / 1000000
          ).toFixed(1)} people</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>🗣️</span>${Object.values(
            data.languages
          ).join(', ')}</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>💰</span>${
            Object.values(data.currencies)[0].name
          }</p>
        </div>
      </article>
    `;

    countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
    countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
  });
};

getCountryAndNeighbour('india');
```

- Again, we get country as an input and then we do our first AJAX call.
- Once the load event is fired (when the data arrives), we then handle that data.
- Now let's export the functionality of creating an html element and inserting it into the DOM in its own function. So, that we can call it not just for the original country but also, its neighbouring countries.

```javascript
const renderCountry = function (data) {
  const html = `
      <article class="country">
        <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.svg}" />
        <div class="country__data">
          <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
          <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
          <p class="country__row"><span>👫</span>${(
            +data.population / 1000000
          ).toFixed(1)} people</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>🗣️</span>${Object.values(
            data.languages
          ).join(', ')}</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>💰</span>${
            Object.values(data.currencies)[0].name
          }</p>
        </div>
      </article>
    `;

  countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
};

const getCountryAndNeighbour = function (country) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);
  request.send();

  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
    console.log(data);
    renderCountry(data);
  });
};

getCountryAndNeighbour('india');
```

- The UI should look the same as before at this point.
- Now let's get the neighbour country.

```javascript
const renderCountry = function (data) {
  const html = `
      <article class="country">
        <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.svg}" />
        <div class="country__data">
          <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
          <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
          <p class="country__row"><span>👫</span>${(
            +data.population / 1000000
          ).toFixed(1)} people</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>🗣️</span>${Object.values(
            data.languages
          ).join(', ')}</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>💰</span>${
            Object.values(data.currencies)[0].name
          }</p>
        </div>
      </article>
    `;

  countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
};

const getCountryAndNeighbour = function (country) {
  // AJAX call country 1
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);
  request.send();

  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
    console.log(data);

    // Render country 1
    renderCountry(data);

    // Get neighbour country (2)
    const neighbour = data?.borders?.[0];

    // if there is no neighbouring country, return
    if (!neighbour) return;

    // AJAX call country 2
    const request2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request2.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/${neighbour}`);
    request2.send();
  });
};

getCountryAndNeighbour('india');
```

- Now just like beofore, we have to listen for the load event on request2.

```javascript
const renderCountry = function (data) {
  const html = `
      <article class="country">
        <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.svg}" />
        <div class="country__data">
          <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
          <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
          <p class="country__row"><span>👫</span>${(
            +data.population / 1000000
          ).toFixed(1)} people</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>🗣️</span>${Object.values(
            data.languages
          ).join(', ')}</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>💰</span>${
            Object.values(data.currencies)[0].name
          }</p>
        </div>
      </article>
    `;

  countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
};

const getCountryAndNeighbour = function (country) {
  // AJAX call country 1
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);
  request.send();

  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
    console.log(data);

    // Render country 1
    renderCountry(data);

    // Get neighbour country (2)
    const neighbour = data?.borders?.[0];

    // if there is no neighbouring country, return
    if (!neighbour) return;

    // AJAX call country 2
    const request2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request2.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/${neighbour}`);
    request2.send();

    request2.addEventListener('load', function () {
      console.log(this.responseText);
    });
  });
};

getCountryAndNeighbour('india');
```

- You are starting to see now that the second AJAX call, in the way we are setting it up here, is really dependent on the first one.
- That's because we are firing up second AJAX call in the callback function of the first one.
- Basically, inside of the callback function, we are now adding a new event listener for the new request.
- Now if we look at the console, we indeed get the data about Bangladesh, a neighbouring country to India.
- And now, no matter how many times we re-load the page, the data about Bangladesh will always appear after India, because there is no way that the second AJAX call can be made before the first one - in our example.
- Now let's render the neighbouring country on our UI.

```javascript
const renderCountry = function (data, className = '') {
  const html = `
      <article class="country ${className}">
        <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.svg}" />
        <div class="country__data">
          <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
          <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
          <p class="country__row"><span>👫</span>${(
            +data.population / 1000000
          ).toFixed(1)} people</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>🗣️</span>${Object.values(
            data.languages
          ).join(', ')}</p>
          <p class="country__row"><span>💰</span>${
            Object.values(data.currencies)[0].name
          }</p>
        </div>
      </article>
    `;

  countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
};

const getCountryAndNeighbour = function (country) {
  // AJAX call country 1
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);
  request.send();

  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
    console.log(data);

    // Render country 1
    renderCountry(data);

    // Get neighbour country (2)
    const neighbour = data?.borders?.[0];

    // if there is no neighbouring country, return
    if (!neighbour) return;

    // AJAX call country 2
    const request2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request2.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/${neighbour}`);
    request2.send();

    request2.addEventListener('load', function () {
      const data2 = JSON.parse(this.responseText).pop();
      console.log(data2);
      renderCountry(data2, 'neighbour');
    });
  });
};

getCountryAndNeighbour('india');
```

- Once again, the second AJAX call would not have been possible without the first one.
- So, what we have here is one callback function inside of another one.
- In other words, we have nested callbacks.
- But now imagine that we wanted to do more in sequence, like the neighbour of the neighbour of the neighbour - 10 times over.
- In that case, we would end up with 10 times over nested callback functions.
- For that kind of structure/behavior, we have a special name, which is <ins>callback hell</ins>.
- Basically, callback hell is when we have a lot of nested callbacks in order to execute asynchronous tasks in sequence.
- In fact, this happens for all asynchronous tasks, which are handled by callbacks - and not just AJAX calls.
- For example:

```javascript
// callback hell another example:
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('1 second passed');
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('2 seconds passed');
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('3 seconds passed');
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('4 seconds passed');
      }, 1000);
    }, 1000);
  }, 1000);
}, 1000);
```

- Here too of course, we have callback hell.
- In fact, callback hell is pretty easy to identify by the triangular shape that is formed, that you can see in the example above.
- The problem with callback hell is that it makes our code look very messy. But even more important, it makes our code harder to maintain, very difficult to understand and to reason about.
- This kind of code will have more bugs thereby making it worse code.
- RULE: The code that is hard to understand, is basically bad code, because it will have more bugs. This is because the harder it is to understand code and to reason about, the more difficult it will be to add new features and to add more functionality to the application.
- Given all these problems with callback hell, we of course need a way to solve callback hell.
- Fortunately for us, since ES6, there is actually a way of escaping callback hell by using something called <ins>promises</ins>.
- So, let's now take the next step in our journey of asynchronous JS, which is to learn about promises.

### Promises and the Fetch API

- In the last lesson we got a glimpse into callback hell and it was not pretty.
- In this lesson, let's learn about a modern JavaScript feature called <ins>promises</ins>, so that we can escape callback hell.
- However, before we learn about promises, we should actually see one.
- So, let's now replace the old `XMLHttpRequest()` function with the modern way of making AJAX calls - and that is by using the Fetch API.
- This is how we do it:

```javascript
// using XMLHttpRequest()
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/india`);
request.send();

// using fetch API
const request = fetch(`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/india`);
console.log(request);
```

- Now there are some more options that we can specify in the `fetch()` function, if we'd like but, to make a simply request like the one we have above, all we really need is to pass in the URL, that's it.
- So, for more complex AJAX calls, the `fetch()` function can take in an object of options as well, but for now, we don't need that.
- Now, we check the console, after logging in the request, we see that the `fetch()` function immediately returned a promise.
- So, as soon as we started the request, stored the result in `request` variable, and then logged it, we immediately got a promise in the console - and right next to it, in the angle brackets, it says pending.
- If we expand it, then it says "fulfilled" and then we also have a promise value.
- What matters here is that now we actually have a promise and it is stored in the `request` variable.
- But, what exactly is a promise, and what can we do with it?

#### What are promises?

- The formal definition of a promis is that it is an object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.
- If that sounds weird to you, we can also say that a promise is like a container for an asynchronously delivered value. OR a promise is a container for a future value.
- A perfect example of a future value is the response coming from an AJAX call.
- So, when we start an AJAX call, there is no value yet, but we know that there will be some value in the future. So, we can use a promise to handle this future value.
- This will really make sense once we go back to code.
- But to understand this concept even better, we can use the analogy of a lottery ticket.

- A promise is just like a lottery ticket. When we buy a lottery ticket, we essentially buy a promise that we will receive some amount of money in the future if we guess the correct outcome.
- So, we buy the ticket now with the prospect of winning money in the future and the lottery draw - which determines if we get the money or not happens asynchronously.
- So, of course, we don't have to drop everything and keep waiting until the lottery draw happens.
- Now, in case we did get the corret outcome, we will receive the lottery money because we have the lottery ticket which is a promise that we bought.
- Now, what's the advantage of using promises?
- There are two actually.
- First, by using promises, we no longer have to rely on events and callback functions to handle asynchronous results.
- Events and callback functions can sometimes cause unpredictable results so, it is a big win already.
- But even better, with promises, we can chain promises for a sequence of asynchronous operations instead of nesting, like we did in the last lesson.
- With this, we can finally escape callback hell, which was our initial goal, all along.
- By the way, promises are an ES6 feature i.e. they became available in JS in 2015 so by now, they are widely used by everyone.

#### The Promise Lifecycle

- Since promises work with asynchronous oeprations, they are time sensitive.
- So, they change over time.
- So, promises can be in different state and this is what they call the cycle of a promise.

- In the very beginning, we say that a promise is pending. This is before any value resulting from the asynchronous task is available.
- During this time, the asynchronous task is still doing its work in the background.
- Then when the task finally finished, we say that the promise is settled.
- There are two different types of settled promises:
  - Fulfilled promises
    - A fulfilled promise is a promise that has successfully resulted in a value, just as we expect it.
    - For example, when we use the promise to fetch data from an API, a fulfilled promise successfully gets that data, and it is now available to being used.
  - Rejected promises
    - A rejected promise means that there has been an error during the asynchronous task.
    - For example, in the case of fetching data from an API, an error would be for example, when the user is offline and cannot connect to the API server.
- Going back to the analogy of the lottery ticket, the lottery draw is basically the asynchronous task, which determines the result.
- Once the result is available, the ticket would be settled.
- If we guessed the correct outcome, the lottery ticket will be fulfilled and we get our money.
- However, if we guessed wrong, then the ticket basically gets rejected and all we did was waste our money.
- These different states are very important to understand because when we use promises in our code, we will be able to handle these different states in order to do something as a result of either a successful promise or a rejected one.
- Another important thing about promises is that a promise is only settled once so, from there, the state will remain unchanged forever.
- So, the promise was either fulfilled or unchanged but, it's impossible to change that state.
- These different states that we just observed are relevant and useful when we use a promise to get a result, which is called, <ins>to consume a promise</ins>.
- We consume a promise when we already have a promise, for example, the promise that was returned from the `fetch()` function, right at the beginning of this lesson.
- But in order for a promise to exist in the first place, it must first be built i.e. it must be created.
- In the case of fetch API, it is the `fetch()` function that builds the promise and returns it for us to consume.
- So, in this case, we don't have to build the promise ourselves in order to consume it.
- Most of the time, we will actually just consume promises, which is also the easier and more useful part. So, that's what we will do in the next couple of lessons.
- But sometimes, we also need to build a promise and not just consume it. Of course we will learn how to do that, a bit later.
- Let's start using promises in the next lesson.
