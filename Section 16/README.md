# Section 16: Asynchronous JavaScript - Promises, Async/Await, and AJAX

**About:** Let's now continue learning important JavaScript features. One topic that we haven't touched yet is asynchronous JavaScript. The goal of asynchronous JavaScript is basically to deal with long-running tasks, that basically run in the background. The most common use case of asynchronous JavaScript is to fetch data from remote servers, in so-called AJAX calls. That's what we will do in this section, while learning everything there is to learn about Promises, the fetch function, async/await, and error handling.
