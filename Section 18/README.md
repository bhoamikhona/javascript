# Section 18: Forkify App - Building a Modern Application

**About:** In this section we take everything that we have learned throughout the course and put it all into one beautiful, modern, and really advanced application. We will use things like classes, modules, promises, async/await, parcel, and so much more. Also, we are going to dive even deeper into flow charts and project architecture in this project so that you become more and more confident and prepared to actually write applications by yourself. This will be a ton of work but also, a lot of fun. So, let's get started.
