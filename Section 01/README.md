# Section 01: Introduction

**About:** Before we deep dive into our course, let's take a couple of minutes to get a quick overview of how the course is organized, and the projects that we're going to build together, so that you know what to expect. This course contains 20 sections with over 60 hours of video content.

## Sections

### [Section 01](./): Introduction

- Overview of the course, documents, materials, basic setup of IDE.

### [Section 02](../Section%2002): JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 01 & [Section 03](../Section%2003): JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 02

- We are going to kick off the course in sections 02 and 03 with the very basics of the JavaScript language, to give you a solid foundation for the rest of the course.

### [Section 04](../Section%2004): How to Navigate this Course

### [Section 05](../Section%2005): Developer Skills & Editor Setup

- Then you will learn some general skills that you will need as a developer, like problem solving, fixing errors, and setting up a development environment.

### [Section 06](../Section%2006): HTML & CSS Crash Course (Optional)

> [!NOTE]
> I have already finished an entire course on these two technologies. Here is the link to its repository: [HTML & CSS Bootcamp](https://github.com/bhoamikhona/html-css-bootcamp)

### [Section 07](../Section%2007): JavaScript in the Browser: DOM and Events Fundamentals

- After that, we build our very first project with a user interface. So, this section is about DOM manipulation, and we will build not one but, three beautiful, yet simple applications.

### [Section 08](../Section%2008): How JavaScript Works Behind the Scenes

- In section 08, we will take a detailed look behind the scenes of JavaScript language to learn how the language actually works.
- This will give you valuable knowledge that many other developers simply don't have.

### [Section 09](../Section%2009): Data Structures, Modern Operators, and Strings & [Section 10](../Section%2010): A Closer Look at Functions

- In sections 09 and 10, we will keep working on our JavaScript fundamentals, but now with a focus on more modern ES6 topics, such as maps and destructuring along with strings, functions, closures, and more.

### [Section 11](../Section%2011): Working with Arrays & [Section 12](../Section%2012): Numbers, Dates, Intl, and Timers

- Throughout section 11 and 12, we will build our next beautiful project, which will teach us all we need to know about array methods, numbers, dates, and timers.

### [Section 13](../Section%2013): Advanced DOM and Events

- After that, we jump right into our next project which is going to be a beautiful website, full packed with visual effects and components such as lazy image loading, a tabbed component, a slider, and so much more.

### [Section 14](../Section%2014): Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with JavaScript

- In section 14, we finally reach the pretty advanced and very important topic of object-oriented programming with constructor functions and ES6 classes.

### [Section 15](../Section%2015): Mapty App: OOP, Geolocation, External Libraries, and More!

- Lessons learned from section 14 will allow us to build a stunning, real world project in this section. Besides object-oriented programming, this section will also teach you how to incorporate a map, and how to actually plan and structure a project, which is also super important.

### [Section 16](../Section%2016): Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises, Async/Await, and AJAX

- In this section, we will learn all about asynchronous JavaScript, which is used for things like loading data from external web servers with AJAX.

## [Section 17](../Section%2017): Modern JavaScript Development: Modules, Tooling, and Functional & [Section 18](../Section%2018): Forkify App: Building a Modern Application

- In sections 17 and 18, we will learn how modern JavaScript applications are actually built using cutting edge technologies like NPM, Babel, Parcel, and ES6 modules.
- We then take all these modern tools and everything that we have learned up until this point, to build the biggest and coolest project in the course.

### [Section 19](../Section%2019): Setting Up Git and Deployment

- We finish by deploying the project we built in section 17 and 18 to the internet using Netlify and Git in section 19.

### Section 20: The End!
